100pips this month.

System Based on moving average, 5 open position per day. The positions can stay open for several days. The system is an Expert Advisor under metatrader platform. Our staff can be do hand operations if necessary. We can open opposite positions in order to stop and reverse the new positions.
This is one of my favorite Moving Average systems,I'm using the best producing pairs from my other systems, will start with CHFJPY and expand from there. Time frames are 4hr and Daily,No scalping here!! Trades can run for a long time, stop losses are kept close. Still as with any trading, money management is key. Good luck and PIP's for all.
I am primarily trading with EUR/USD, but also with GBP/USD or EUR/JPY and sometimes with EUR/CHF. Stopp loss: primarily 0-200 Pips (sometimes more) Take Profit: primarily 1-200 Pips (sometimes more). Maximum open trades: 30 Trades in total. Normally I close my trades within 48 tradinghours. My trading time is from 06:00 until 22:00 ETC.
Good day to all - Azar is back ! I am trading a mixture of markets (CFD's) and will continue to do so from this point forward. The new mixture includes no FX trades - Only CFD's! This is for those who would like to invest for the longer term, I will be opening one trade per week or month depending on my analysis. This is also a Buy only or long only strategy! Please listen carefully on how to allocate your capital: Invest no more than 10% per trade per type of CFD! Therefore if you have 10000 USD invest no more than 1000 USD per trade per type of CFD such as SP500. I have many types of CFD's (SP500, UK100, US30 ect...) , therefore I would advise you to use this same for each type. I would advise you to take 1% of your capital and invest this per trade until your total allotment has been invested - you do this so you can spread your risk and not invest it all at once that might be a bad time to start. If you do not understand - leave a message and I will get back to you with another example! Money management is extremely important here! May you all be Blessed!

12/18/2015 Hello Subscribers, this strategy will day trade and swing positions. Denver is swinging the current positions and room is needed for any oscillations in values. Subscribers should limit the number of contracts to what is appropriate for them as a way to mitigate risk. Subscribers not wanting to swing positions longer term may need to close out the positions themselves accordingly going into any weekend. Denver uses a number of indicators and the type of trading will adjust any vary according to the current period. At times tight day trading and other times swing trades requiring more room to fluctuate. Denver will try to adjust to what may be the best risk/reward at any time and use the type of trading to take advantage of it. The goal is a good return over time with a recommended minimum time frame of 3 - 6 months. Denver will do its best to continue to hit new high after new high. The strategy chart illustrates the history of fluctuations from the beginning. Use risk capital and do not over leverage. Your subscriptions are appreciated.

This system has fixed stop loss. There will be winning weeks and losing weeks but the winning weeks will outperform the bad ones. This system has a trail system in place and designed to give the best risk return. There will be losing weeks but the winning weeks will outweigh the losers. I don't believe in letting a trade run against you and then just hoping that it will come in your favor. We have a well defined system and if a trade goes against us, we will stop it.

Dear followers, please note, that it is very important to open all my trades to have the same performance, because sometimes it`s necessary to close trades at avarage and if you don`t open all trades it could happen that you have only the first trades open which were closed with losses. I will never open moren than 4-5 trades at the same time. So please correctly manage your deposit, use correct money management (max-0.01 lot per ca. 180-200 $ amount). It`s better to reduce the lot size and allow to open since a maximum of 5 trades. Thank you

When sense of direction came out, I do short-term buying and selling mainly. I buy and sell EURUSD mainly. When I have plural positions, there is it. The business is until Monday through Friday, and the position of the holiday has it. Or the same number has buying and selling on the weekend, too. When latent loss becomes big, there is it.
esta estrategia esta basada en compras y ventas sobre los pares de divisas fundamentales, lo haremos en pares correlaccionados y en operaciones de 1 dia como maximo con 12 contratos al final del dia como maximo, un minimo de 4 contratos. El capital minimo necesario para esta estrategia sera de 1200 dolares y un maximo de 2000. Las operaciones deben de seguirse completamente para tener buenos resultados.
Right now the two big drawdowns are still in play. My system shows that they will come back within the next week or so. They should close out at a profit.

我依舊看好美元，目前頭寸虧損較大，未來會嚴格控管，也請跟隨者勿重倉，平均分攤風險

Do you want to achieve good results? Adjusting the size of the lot to the position of capital. Let me open all your transactions. Reducing the number of transactions is not advisable! We look forward to a reversal of the trend. It is hoped that soon it will happen. In case of further growth is possible to open the next item.

Je change ma stratégie. Je prends position sur une durée de 4 heures. Je prends une position à la fois. Celle-ci peut être prise sur plusieurs jours. Mon trading est basé uniquement sur une analyse technique.
Уважаемые подписчики. Январь получился убыточным. Сейчас ситуация выравнивается. В дальнейшем надеюсь прибыльность торговли не будет ниже, чем в предыдущие периоды.

**** Trading In EUR/GPB **** Slow and steady wins the race, trading the EUR/GPB MOSTLY in the calm ASIAN hours to prevent huge drawdowns. **** Recommended CONSERVATIVE settings with a 100:1 leverage account: - 0.01 micro lot (10 cents a pip) per $1000-2000 in account **** Recommended AGGRESSIVE settings with a 100:1 leverage account: - 0.01 micro lot (10 cents a pip) per $500-1000 in account **** Trading In EUR/GPB **** Slow and steady wins the race, trading the EUR/GPB MOSTLY in the calm ASIAN hours to prevent huge drawdowns. Keep in mind, I sometime have big drawdown, but do not get greedy and oversize your lots. If you are going to be using lot sizes larger than what I recommend above, then I would suggest a SL of 250 per trade, but do understand it will get hit so please don't post negative comments when it does. My strategy will not be directly applying this SL unless I manually set it, so it will give those who do not set a SL the option to ride out the trades. Check my performance history to see how often, and to see how long it takes to recover. The important thing is to obey Zulutrade's margin call-o-meter as it is very accurate. Practice safe money management and we will be successful. For your safety margin please use 1 micro lot for every $1000, it's mean 0.01 lot for $1000 account

It's a fairly ordinary mechanical trend following system with a rather strange exit (which seems to work nevertheless). Trend following systems typically produce more losing trades than winning ones, but the winners tend to out-weight the losers in terms of size. One might expect a good trend following system to produce a winning trade to losing trade ratio of around 60/40 with the 40% of winning trades (on average) winning 2 to 3 times as much a losing trade typically loses.

There will be no changes to trading strategy. We all can make assumptions that are based on history. There is no other way. Thats exactly what I did. I tested strategy, found it worth to use and offered to others. But do not expect too much, nobody can predict future. If it would be possible then Zulutrade TOP will always be the same. In overall it is very simple - strategy will survive or will fail. Will it fail or not? I dont know. In tests on history biggest DD was twice then current so I assume that strategy is still valid.

My strategy works on both downtrends and uptrends. I use it as a swing trading strategy. Depending on how I want to utilize the strategy, either as day trading or swing trading I set exit points based on trading and market conditions. Mostly I like using trailing stops. Simplify, simplify, simplify are the words I read every day as I begin my trading day. I love simple strategies because they work.
EUR/USD is falling so fast that the average Q4 2015 EURUSD forecast is now above spot and every single strategist in the world is bearish. Clearly the rate of decline is unsustainable but there is infinite supply and no demand right now so some sort of overshoot is likely. Thats exactly what we will do now - we will use the markets madness regarding EUR weakness.
The strategy provides for profit in the long term. The strategy allows a large number of open positions in the long term, so please use a minimum lot size and allow all trades. In general, one side open positions amount not more than 15. Per year on average earned 15000 pips profit. Trading currency pair is USD/CHF.

Well the trades are ok but what I have done wrong is the trail aspect. I had it coded so that the trail would kick in under certain conditions and this gave better results than just having it kick in at a certain amount of pips. The conditions never happened for a few trades. Maybe better results over the long term but clearly this is annoying. I already have a few adjustments. Also I am trading my own money on this account. I am FXCM with about 485 pips.

I passionatly look foward to trading and I love every minute of it. I plan to trade charts and fundemental news with a resonable stop loss. My financial experience is I worked on Wall Street as a proprietary trader for 8 years before trading my own capital. All trades are discretionary and you can loose money on any trade. Use your lots wizely and do not use to much leverage because that could end up with massive losses. That being said I look foward to making all my clients a substantial monthly income.

Busco entradas diarias en cruces de medías moviles de 4horas vistas (no entro en tendencias), en operaciones negativas cierro en 85 pips de perdidas, si la operación es positiva espero maduración de la posible tendencia y cierro en 180 pips o hasta que pierda fuerza o volumen cerrando en 20 pips seguros, tengo ganancias altas a largo plazo, espero sus afiliaciones
Mi estrategia consiste en estudiar los soportes y las resistencias de diversos pares de divisas para minimizar el riesgo, las ordenes se darán teniendo en cuenta los niveles de soportes y resistencias así como el punto pivote que marca casi siempre la tendencia que seguirá el par. Teniendo en cuenta estos niveles de soporte y resistencia se fijan un stop-loss para minimizar las perdidas que son inevitables , ya que no se puede pensar siempre en ganar ,de modo que en todo momento se tiene conocimiento del riesgo por cada operacion abierta.

I am a day trader for 6 yrs, I do trade mainly on hk index, ES and euro currency. I will follow the trend to provide signals based on moving averages, the bar pattern and another strategy to catch the top and bottom. My cut loss shud be within NET 150 pips by the end of the day.
This strategy is based upon trading the higher time frames with proven price action signals.Trading signals on the higher time frames are more reliable and will always lead to consistent profits in the long term.Entries will be taken on proven price patterns which occur at important support and resistance levels.I define important levels in the market as horizontal levels on the the 4 hour and daily charts,I will also be using fibonacci ratios on the daily chart and intraday charts as important levels of support and resistance.

After years of experimentation I have improved my trading strategy and now feel confident that money can be made in this market consistently but there is no short cut. This system will make money consistently and without large drawdowns. The trade is made towards the trend and at major support/resistance levels.
Hello Followers, the market moves strong. The only way out of this situation is to wait until the price come down.
Dear investors, please do not be panic . My strategy is still capture the long term profit. The macro trend for strong USD still not change. The bad debt of ECB is accounted for 9% of its GDP. That means the QE of Europe just start and will not end in short time. So please be patient and you will get what you wait for.

Dear traders Im not taking a break we are just waiting for good session overnight before we start trading.
trying to reduce any future DD by being carefull.
重新起航！！
the trade, the first decision is not always right, sometimes it can go wrong, even when the results of a second benefit, then for those of you who follow me, it is advisable to follow a minimum of three to five positions. I combined some world class traders analysis with personal experience in the analysis, after a lengthy analysis, so I found a compelling target. I spent a lot of time to analyze. good luck.
Regarding AUDNZD trades, please note that I am long from different levels (1.0975, 11160); the RBNZ surprised with a rate cut, and that certainly hurt NZD. I decided to keep these positions (+ 1,200 pips profit at this moment) and I suspect we may potentially break 1.1350 (1st target) and book profits at 1.1425 (2nd target). If we break these levels price may reach 1.16 (3rd target) or even 1.20. Stop loss is moved up to 1.1140 (short-term major low). The RBNZ is likely to take advantage of its rate decision to talk down the kiwi. Regarding USDJPY, to confirm a stronger advance, the price needs to extend beyond the 114.60. Regarding GBPUSD, the dollar has been broadly lower in March, and the pound has taken full advantage. We’ve got a big corrective move against the bearish trend. US fundamentals remain stronger than the UK and I remain bearish on GBP/USD.

Dear followers, First, thank you for long-term trust and support. Now I specifically addressed my trading strategy. Comprehensive timing of transactions is the core of my trading strategy. My judgment is based on economic data, events and other market comprehensive information. If the situation is less clear,i will not do it or less to do,if there is a transaction,i will offers a stop-loss. If I am sure to make a clear judgment,my transaction becomes positive and cover short positions,of course, I will also set a stop-loss according the situation,and the points will be relatively large. Please note that. thanks! 翻译

trade is conducted by standard rules: 1. The fundamental analysis are the most important world news: economic and political. Plus the general situation in the developed countries of the big seven. 2. The technical analysis – construction of schedules and lines of supports/resistance. 3. Known indicators – moving averages and volumes,he strategy works with relatively medium leverage and medium risk.
Hello everyone . last month was very slow. i'm hoping market should pick up over coming weeks. low volume =low trade signals =low profits.
Hello. I'm not lost. still here, still trading ;)
Dear friend, thanks for your words. I am actually experiencing a little bit of drawdown I apologize for this, I was caught off guard with Aud/usd (I think to go short another time to search to recoup some drawdown as technical situation is of very overbought, i hate this risky situation so I'll watch it very close) , and in respect to eur/usd the volatility has been huge and now we have to wait the dust settle down. I think Euro will suffer again this year and maybe significantly. Resistance level are 113-116-123. I hope we will stop at the first barrier this should confirm the weakness of this pair. Finally, mantain a position short eurusd doesn't erode the capital. Good luck to all.

Dear followers. I trade in many currency pairs. recommendation to be copied: 1 to 2 open positions for funds under $ 10,000. 3 to 5 open positions for funding above $ 10,000. thank you

I wanted to make clear to you guys, that have doubts about the draw-down and such: this system is not for the suicidal people who will set a lot for each operation, when they only have a thousand bucks deposit. That set up will not result in a positive way, but will only have meant a waste of time and money. For the serious investor who cares for steady and long time profit, here's my recommendation: use 1 micro-lot for each thousand dollars you own. For example, your account has 5 thousand dollars, so, you will set 5 micro-lots for each order. This way, your risk will only be 10% of your account at every moment. If you wanna risk more, have this in mind please. Best wishes for all

Dear follower, I could say to be patient but I won't say that. I prefer to talk with my coming results.
We are in the middle of corrections in the Yen crosses. The Yen will take center stage as a risk adverse trade. There will be a lot of money to be made.
July 25th>> To the last comment. You are absolutely correct. Anybody who is still following me here is what I would do. Keep track of me but don't trade with this account right now or just assign a micro lot to it. This account will snap back. I am sure of it. By Sept 1st I will be back in the top 20. Thanks! Thomas

Hi AAA1538446F , trade are open are with stoploss set, typically, it will be less than 60pips. When trade going to into positive after clearing lower timeframe support or resistance, stoploss will then shift in stage to protect the capital and secure the profit for maximised return. Strategy will be constantly review to react to the market situation.
Hi everyone ! AVA1036074F please read our description carefully : Based on the USDJPY long term trend, which should become stronger in the next few months, we plan to record our best year in 2015. Indeed, our economists expect the BOJ increase its QE while the FED should hike rates in the US. If any change in terms of monetary policies comes up, our quants would immediately adapt our algos. Has the situation changed on the market ? No. Have we been wrong so far ? No. Enjoy !

FXCM1373273F: welcome on board and thank you for following me. I am sorry you had a small loss today, but you copied my open trades, I closed them in profit, but for you it was a small loss. BTW...I have noticed that your Margin-o-Call shows 279% which is too risky for your trading account. You should lower your lot size for some of signal providers you are currently following. To be safe, your MOC should be set below 80%. I wish you a wonderful day and many green trades.

Only manual trading. Currency pairs : ___ EUR/USD ___ . Max 1 (ONE) open trade. Always check Zulutrade's margin Call-O-Meter or use automatic risk settings. My recommended settings : 0.01 lots for every 100 usd in your account. Maximum open trades 1 (if you want receive the same results as ours). !!! Difference from my other signals --- only ONE open trade and less profit / less risk / less trades / very small DD !!!
Finally approaching parity as expected by major market players, as the US economy shows they are strongly improving in almost every area, except wages that are still gaining momentum. This is a natural consequence of long lasting depression in the markets, specially because at this point, only the US shows the potential to wake up and move forward as the world's locomotive that will pull the economy (again, historically). Besides the US, we have China and German that are heading towards a more stable pace, with the Asian giant moving its policies to a more sustainable growth rate (5%-7%/year long term), and the leading European nation ruling as one of the few (if not the only one) countries that still envisions a growing economy in 2015-2016. That being said, the USD may continue its rise until we see the FED raising rates for the first time in years, which will likely happen early in the third quarter, as long as the number keep their strength and current trend. Whether this valuation will stop in parity, nobody knows. But we know that Europe has a plan, and it's likely that the worst phase was left behind and we may see a slow, yet consistent recovery after the strong Central Banks easing across most European countries, in addition to a weak Euro which may boost exports, tourism and further investments. The USD/EUR parity will have a psychological effect on trading and we may see the pair standing for a good period with high volatility around that 1:1 rate. This is typically a turning point scenario where traders will decide whether the US economy will keep its pace and leave Europe behind (with further USD valuation), or perhaps Europe will start improving and follow the US on a potential recovery across the continent. In this latter scenario, we may experience a pull back and EUR may rise against the USD, offsetting the strong recent sell-off and bringing the pair to stability again. We expect, however, that such reversal may occur by year end, with a sideline

Our algorithmic system is based on timing and price action, it was tested on 13 years of data and has shown great and consistent results. We will RARELY open more than 8 trades in a row, please do not close the trades with small profits: this is a swing weekly strategy, this means that we usually aim for 50-300 pips, expect from us very high returns with just few trades! Thanks for your trust, and happy profits!

Good luck to you.

Drawdowns such as this has been in the past. It's part of the job. I will correct the situation.
This system uses the grid transaction and the trend of trading co operation, when there is a profit when, move the stop in the form of profit, the profit to achieve the maximization. Using a short-term strategy and long-term strategy combination mode. The stability of earnings is the key to success.
This is system looks for short term and long term opportunity for EUR/CAD and USD/CAD. This system has low draw down and short average trading time. I apply this strategy has been back tested for many years data and found to be continuously profitable. I apply this strategy to this account since April 2015. It has been working very well. feel free to check my trading history.
Моя стратегия является достаточно простой. Первоначальная позиция открывается минимальным объемом, в случае проигрыша происходит открытие позиции с удвоением объема. Для чего используются отложенные ордера. Кроме того для открытия первоначальной позиции используются индикаторы stochastic , MACD. Всегда выставляется ограничение убытка stop-loss. Просьба учитывать, что Forex - это высокорискованный рынок и не стоит вкладывать все средства в одного трейдера.

Dear followers everything has been changed..................before invest read the strategy description.
We are more focused on our performance at the end of the month than having an ultra high success ratio. So if a trade turns against us, we will cut it loose instead of holding it until price comes back so we can exit with a small profit. This strategy is followed by others, but it is short sighted and can lead to large losses.Hedging is possible. Over the last 30 years, we have learned that we cannot predict the future with certainty. But with a good strategy, risk management and money management, it is possible to earn superior returns over time. Put our experience to work and join us in this adventure as we navigate the global FX market. Good day, and good trading!

before copying you should first consider how to trade a signal provider. do you obsessed with rankings, it helps you pay attention to a trade strategy signal provider. I think the best ranking is not everything in achieving the best possible results as well. in my view that the most important thing to consider is: how to adjust the signal provider to trade your account condition. attention of the DD signal providers that will follow as DD is the most important part for your account security. to copy all open positions should you choose a low DD.

Dear Followers, In order to follow me with proper money management you need to adjust the trade size based on your account equity. For every $1000, you can set to trade 1 lot or for every $10,000 you can set to trade 10 lot and for every $100,000 , you set to trade 100 lot which is equal to 1 standard lot. in my trades i will follow the same money management. Now that i have over $100,000 equity in my account i am trading 7 to 8 standard lot each session. Good luck to you all.

Отношение минимального депозита к лоту из расчета: 250$/0,01 lot. Торговый советник написан мной лично для торговли валютной пары EUR/USD и использует свечные конфигурации. Советник ведет торговлю следующим образом: депозит от 0-499$ - использует 0,01 лот, депозит 500-649$ - использует 0,02 лота, депозит 750-999$ - 0,03 лота и т.д., с увеличение баланса на 250$ увеличивается лот на 0,01 (сохранена пропорциональность).Прибыльность советника (тестировал с 2007 по нынешнее время) 80%-120% за 1 год.

I think it is true, that no one is always right in making predictions, and errors are frequent traders are emotional factors. I tried to manage the emotions as much as possible. in my analysis combines several techniques to look for trends, after finding the trend of a few options and then selecting one of the best, when to enter the market to bring a conviction, despite market ups and downs I remain calm, good luck.
Please enlarge some single volume control, and at the same time open the largest 19 single positions set $300 with 0.01 hand, thank you

We are more focused on our performance at the end of the month than having an ultra high success ratio. So if a trade turns against us, we will cut it loose instead of holding it until price comes back so we can exit with a small profit. This strategy is followed by others, but it is short sighted and can lead to large losses.Hedging is possible. Over the last 30 years, we have learned that we cannot predict the future with certainty. But with a good strategy, risk management and money management, it is possible to earn superior returns over time. Put our experience to work and join us in this adventure as we navigate the global FX market. Good day, and good trading!

Hi all. I'm on Zulutrade since 101 weeks. Each month i earn a lot of pip. Yes my drawdown is high. But my profit is High too. I have stop loss. Big stop loss because i use TF H4. So high volatility = high stop loss and high take profit too. I'm really serious. I use this strategy on real big account on private broker.... You have to be patient and open all my trade. Don't cut too fastly my trades. Let me do my job. I know what i'm doing. I'm not new here. Thank you so much. Richard

Analysis on top of day trade pivots on major instruments. This EA watches the signals looking for repeated crossingof significative points for a given symbol. After it crosses down on a relative short time may indicate we are facinga immediate bearish trend. Crossing otherwise up, may indicate a day trade in favour of a bullish market at the next 24 hours. Based on that conclusions, decisions are taken.
bonjour à tous , j'espère que vous êtes satisfaits de notre travail.Comme vous avez pu le constatez nous continuons à faire du profit. J'espère que vous en profiterez.Vous avez remarquez que sur certains trades ,la position est mise à 0 pour profiter au maximum du profit avec un maximum de sécurité.Merci encore
My trade strategy is based on the Elliott wave principle, technical and fundamental analyzes. It allows us to see the basic structure that manages and operates the market behavior. Elliot wave principle is a mathematical theory that shows how crowd behavior or financial markets develops or changes as recognizable models. This trading system brings stable income. In my trading activity I use S/L and T/P. I control deals regularly. Join me and become my subscriber and you won’t regret. I wish you the best of luck.

I follow beautiful trends. I trade GBPJPY. I put the stop-loss at certain distance from the entry point. And, I trail the stop-loss. But, when the beautiful trend finishes, I close the position. There is nothing for it. I take the profit at target point. I use computer automatic trade system.
Dear followers, For the past 4 months from Oct 2014 to Jan 2015 our profit pips were 1727,1322,1204 and 1499 respectively.This month so far 400 pips. As per my stratergy allowing all my signals with 0.01 lot per 1000 US$ account our profits would be 172,132,120 and 150 US$ respectively for the past 4 months. This method will continue every month. We pocket the profits consitently every month. Good luck.
I trade forex has gone more than 8 years, the trading strategy is eight words: direction, location, prediction, operation. Details: to daily charts and four hour chart setting direction of transaction, to map hour positioning admission position, forecast price fluctuations to daily volatility changes, to a 15 minute chart with partial admission funds management operation. Stop 60-100 point, 100-120 point of profit. Technical + capital management + mentality = success!

As you can see , my trading record can prove that I can get profit in the long run, especially, I am good at following the main trend to trade , for example, trade of eur/usd recently. So , don't worry about my trade any more, what you should do is just follow my strategy and set max open trades from 10 to 30, at least 10. Trust me , dear customers, thank you for your support.
New year! New tweaks to the strategy! Stay tuned.

This is a swing trading system that trades in a higher time frame. Sometimes I can open more than one trade at a time as the case may be. My strategy has a setting with a stop loss of plus or minus 150 pips; although I suggest a standard stop loss of 200 pips for each open trade so as to protect your account in case of a big draw down. I don’t have a fixed take profit but only takes my profit when a particular trend finishes. Because it is a swing trading system, my open trade(s) can last for more than a day before I will take my profit. This is profitable trading system, so follow it and have a profitable smooth ride to the top. CHEERS!!!

The goal of this system is not to loose too much and gain something. This is a trading system that trades for long term but recently the currencies are not trending so right now I am trading with 20 to 30 pips TP. The currency pairs are EJ,GJ,EU and GU some times I also trade in AU. This trading system will trade with with long term view so it might be possible that there will be drawdown of 100 pips/trade. Maximum open positions will be 4 at a time. Thanks

Dear Followers, this is to inform you that the system is placing orders on the EURUSD as usual, and since the currency did not retrace back upward, the orders did not become activated. There is no issue with the strategy. There are times when the market will move sharply in one trend without retracement to the opposite side and in this case, the market will not activate our orders. This is exactly what's happening now. There is no need to modify the strategy, such cases happened already historically. All what we need to do is to wait until our strategy conditions become met. Discipline is important, and that's what makes the difference between the winners and the losers at the market. Good Luck... Helal Alkaabi

This signal has changed status to EXPERIMENTAL ONLY.
My strategy is mainly based upon market direction regarding support and resistance observation in 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h. I could open until 8 orders but more frequently 4 at the same time. Orders are opened manually and closed automatically with various number of pips. I try to maintain a 70/30 ratio in gain/loss.

Стратегия дает сбой. Но это не значит, что она не работает. Просадка есть у всех стратегий
Порадовать пока нечем.
This Strategy trades the major currency pairs. I will Day Trade and Swing Trade. Stops are used on all positions. I will manually adjust the stops when I feel appropriate. This strategy may be classified as aggressive relative to Forex. Be diversified and use only risk capital. I believe this may be an excellent vehicle for subscribers to participate and have exposure to Forex. I believe a 3 - 6 month time frame should be a minimum for any strategy. My goal is to try to make this a top rated strategy that maximizes profits, establish good gains for the amount of risk taken and be consistent as possible. The above is a goal not a guarantee. I would like to have my Subscribers accepting Signals for the Long Term. I very much appreciate your business! Thanks

11/16/2015 Bouldering is in the process of positioning for what may be the next meaningful move. Hope the turn is in and may be ready for a longer period of meaningful positive action. May be more bumps in the road ahead, but hope a cycle of larger moves over time will substantially out way this period of change. If one is not able to wait out periods of drawdowns with this or any strategy one may be over leveraged. Goal to have excellent return over time and recommended for minimum of 3 - 6 months of holding time. You subscriptions are appreciated.

my strategy is based on analyzing fundamentals news and technical skills both hand in hand and watch the big rise and enter early and keep it manageable until i confirm the peak or bottom price in the pair so that i exit and or enter reverse ,i wish you a long happy profits with me
My strategy is sma vs smma-cross ( simple vs smoothed moving average -cross ) When the fast sma crosses above the slow smma,I will place long. Then at the reasonable profits,I will exit the trade. For stoploss should be low drawdown. When the fast sma crosses below the slow smma,I will place short. Then at the reasonable profits,I will exit the trade. For stoploss should be low drawdown. This will bring profits to all the valued followers.

For a while I had been broken physical condition. I'm glad to be able to return.


Happy New Year all, hope you had a very Merry Christmas. Looking back at last year, the key takes to think about for your trading and following signals would be to always manage risk correctly by not over exposing your portfolio. The trades i execute on this account make money over the long term and it's not about simply being very aggressive on a short term bases. I control all risk on the positions via the stop loss which is trailed to limit the downside but as we always see, the market can and will change direction any time it wants. So it's important to size your trades that open appropriately to not wipe you out during drawdown periods. We saw our first rate hike for 9 years in Dec, which gave mixed reactions but ultimately moving correctly once the stops had been taken out. The new year looks to give more upwards trajectory for US rates, which should in turn give us good moves to capitalise on and trade with. Happy trading

After over a year of trading our quantitative EA, we're happy to see that the live trading results have matched our historical backtests and walk-forward testing in terms of our profit, accuracy and drawdown. We have, however, decided to remove USD/CAD and focus only on the majors, since our historical edge over this pair is slim and prone high volatility. Check out our stats on our three prime pairs: EUR/USD. GBP/USD, and USD/JPY. We are trading these currencies exclusively as of 08/14. Join us now to earn money!

The USDJPY long position brought quite a bit of work and volatility because I entered it way too early. The contiued low oil price regime of course helps the Japanes foreign trade position significantly therefore I will gradually shift from USDJPY long to other opportunities. In USDJPY we might even start to add tentative short positions at higher levels. Finally back at high-water-mark! :-) Will do my best to add profits from here with less volatility then in recent weeks.

I have increased the DD from September by switching from semi-automatic mode to fully manual mode. I will decrease the DD after I will close USDJPY, the maximum will be around 600 pip.

Dear Followers we will not open new position for remaining days in Jan.We will start again from beginning of February.Let me summarize Jan.We are closing January with +1038 pips according to closed positions.This is record level since Dec 2013.I would like to remind one more time patience is critical to get money from forex steadily.Next month will be tough.Eur/Usd does not want to come below 1.075.If passed this level most probably will go 1.05-1.04 to test lowest levels.We expect USD power this year with the fluctuations.I wish luck and success to all our followers.Best regards

Dear followers, this week we will celebrate 2 years anniversary. Yes OrderTrader is working already for 2 years. Even though we came trough very challenging periods during these time the maximum equity DD was only 25% and profit is stable around 5-10% /mo. The total profit for period was Pips: 17724.7. With trade size of 1 lot it is $177,247
A strategy created carefully for MAXIMUM PROFIT with CALCULATED RISK and better MONEY MANAGEMENT skills, possitively tested with real time trading data, works pretty well on USDCHF pair. This EA scans for previous high and low points to determine when to place order. It is recommended to start off with smaller lot size initially and gradually can increase lot size along the way. Happy ninja trading, Good Luck..

I am going to trade after Greece's elections.
Dear followers, this provider continue work. Pay attention that max quantity of open positions is 100. For trading with the same or smaller relative drawdown your equity must be equal or more than value of the NME parameter. Also you can look at provider Vipro Cons (Vipro Live in the past), where max opened positions and NME will be significantly less (at present about 7 pos and $1000). Vipro.

Hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, Variables such as the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses as well as maintaining adequate liquidity are material points which can adversely affect actual real trading results.

Hi Please note that this is a long term strategy . There aren't many clear entry points that promises a minimum of a 1-2 risk reward ratio. If all conditions for a entry are not there then i do not trade. The target of growing the account by 5% per month is still being reached after 13 months of difficult market conditions. That target remains my focus point.
On the way back up.
January 15th forever changed the face of forex industry. Brokers went out of business, systems crumbled. I had USDCHF position on my live account and suffered significant losses. I got tilted, bad trades were made and account blew up. I'm taking a break from markets, after that I will rebuild my systems.

I have been engaged in the Forex investment market for more than 3 years. mainly invest in a pair EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD, GBPJPY n EURJPY. I use moving average to determine the trend from the 4H and daily chart. I mainly monitor break of support and resistance. strict adherence to the rules of money management.
I will try to be as accurate and more serious as possible and I will open up to 5 positions with up to 100 pips sl and tp at least 100 pips to have a ratio of at least 1:1 So the maximum DD could attest on 500 pips Preference will be given to the Exchange Eur Usd Let's try this new adventure together basing on trade levels and in particular supports and resistances calculated without EA but only with my method of mathematical calculation Thanks: Mirko Cercherò di essere quanto piu preciso e serio possibile e aprirò max 5 posizioni con sl massimo di 100 pips e tp di almeno 100 pips per avere un rapporto di almeno 1:1 Quindi il massimo DD si potrebbe attestare sui 500 pips La preferenza sarà data al cambio Eur Usd Proviamo insieme questa nuova avventura basando i trade su livelli ed in particolare supporti e resistenze calcolati senza alcun EA ma solo con un mio metodo di calcolo matematico Auguri: Mirko

HI yeah I lost position where I had 265 pip in plus GBG/CHF I must say i was completly surprised by the SNB decision and probably U know that u could lose much more then 265 in one minute. Besides if I think pair can go much higher then 265 why not keep it a bit longer and catch 5 or 6 hundred pips? That is just me as U probably saw I am not typical provision hunter. I am not saying that i dindn't make mistake in that position I should probably put stop close to 0 not lose that position and belive me i wasn't happy about this either if U followed my signal i can olny say SORRY I will try to improve it next time gl in forex and that for comment .

Becouse NFP is coming out on Good Friday, I had to close the trades. Banks and other liquidity providers worldwide will be closed tomorrow. That means it will be extremely low liquidity in the market, and huge spreads. Very risky day to have open trades. The liquidity will start to come back when banks open 8 am NY time 6th of April. I belive it will come good trading opportunities the upcoming week. Have a nice weekend.

Only one factor ,that's not going to change, is aiming to generate profit.
Trading spot currencies involves substantial risk and there is always the potential for loss. Your trading results may vary. Because the risk factor is high in the foreign exchange market trading, only genuine risk funds should be used in such trading. If you do not have the extra capital that you can afford to lose, you should not trade in the foreign exchange market. No safe trading system has ever been devised, and no one can guarantee profits or freedom from loss.

Consistence performance since January 2014 up to now. With very limited draw down, maximum SL is 100-110 pips. I think this is best strategy for investors for gaining 250-300 pips per month over a long period of time. I have been following these trades on my live accounts also with no trade loss more than 1% of equity. (i.e) If you have 10000$ account, one trade not loss more than 100$.
This is a strategy that focus its trades on the main currency pairs. I use both technical and fundamental analysis when I open or close my trades, but the most important element is my years of experience in trading. I use to have stable and constant profits and keep a low drawdown.
I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN FOREX,i TRADE MIX CURRENCIES,I'M GONNA TRY MY VERY BEST TO NOT FAIL YOU.MAXIMUM POSITIONS ARE 10.I ADVICE YOU TO MANAGE YOUR MONEY PROPERLY,IT'S YOUR DUTY TO CONTROL YOUR MONEY AND NOT MINE.SO GOOD LUCK FOR ME AND YOU,LET'S TRY TO HAVE SOME GOOD PROFITS TOGETHER.

Five to six trades maximum. stops at -200 pips (This has turned out to be better and is more in tune with my original style of trade). The long term position selling AUD is still maintained at this stage. The position of currencies involved and economic cycles of main players have not changed.

Dear Followers: I try to provide good signals.
Please stay clam!!!!!!
My strategy was to change and achieve good results. I will maintain the results in the future and control the lowest possible risk.
appreciate if you can change your broker or open a new account in AAAFX as while you are in green most of your followers are in red due to slippage!, Generally you are an excellent trader & you will have thousand of followers as soon as you add other broker. Answer: there is account opened under aaafx - search for ordertrader. But this broker has high spread so performance is not better.

Elliott Wave synchronisation is the future of professional FOREX market analysis and an incredibly good trading system that guarantees you every month superior profits by 500 pips and more in the average! And all of this without the risk of a total loss, because we have a strict stop-loss- and risk-management, so that our chart recovered from each downward movement! Für unsere deutschen Freunde: Dieses sensationelle System basiert auf der Synchronisation der Elliott Wellen nach der Theorie des US-Amerikaners Ralph Nelson Elliott. Gehandelt werden ausschließlich die Majors wie bspw. EURUSD, GBPCHF, EURJPY usw. Empfehlung: Stellen Sie Ihr Handelsvolumen so ein, dass eine Bewegung von 50 Pips/Handel maximal eine Kapitalveränderung von 1% auf Ihrem Konto bedeuten. Damit bewegen Sie sich auf der sicheren Seite und erzielen nach aktuellem Leistungsstand trotzdem im Schnitt beachtliche 5% Gewinn monatlich und darüber. Und nun gute Gewinne mit unseren Signalen!

25th April 2016. Due to other commitments I haven't been able to devote as much time to posting signals through ZuluTrade as I would have liked. I've concentrated on fewer trades but hopefully fewer trades with a higher success chance. My results have been much better over the last few weeks and I intend to maintain this level of success.

Killing Trend.. Now
Dear Traders- our new strategy running from january 2016 and its going well.please invest 800$ for a micro lot and allow 30 max open positions, but we are mostly open one trade at a time, if the trend moves in a sideway market then only we are opening more trades.our instruments are EUR/AUD and USD/TRY only.............have a pipfull life........GOOD LUCK!

Transactions in the market for so many years, I found that right and wrong or view really is not important, the important is not wise, honest always persevere to follow the trend. My system is not complicated, it is a typical trends in the system, the main use of average index, with the price support and resistance, and is the essence of homeopathy, Qingcang, opening. Must understand opening, although not every operation must gallon, but if the market opportunity must rapidly opening. Only in this way can we in the long time period get a positive expectations of income. I hope that from now on, I will give you some good benefits.

Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water. Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
It seems to be a worldwide account smashing !!!!! A monster escaped from the cage. We will be patient until it goes back to raw. I keep my eye on it


My trading method is to track potential positions to a place that they have to make a decision---pick a clear direction. I refer to this place as a limit. I am the sniper that has a specific target and moves swiftly when my target steps in this 'limit zone. • Proper setups, well-timed entries, targeted exits: I seek to execute this sequence, over and over again, day in and day out. • I only trade major currencies, entering in the direction of a trend upon a retest of previously respected trend line, 21 EMA, major fibio level or supply and demand zone. If I believe that it it is likely that a clear trend is starting, then I may choose to scale out, i.e. enter with two positions and bank one at the first logical exit, while leaving the second to run until it definitively breaks the trend line. • No matter how good we are at finding good entries, the market will always invalidate some of them. For the last 6 months we have continued with the following money management rules on this account: (1) Maximum open positions 10 (2) Maximum DD: 400 pips (3) Stops: maximum of 100 pips, often much less, depending on currency pair. (4) Our trading lot size: always 1 lot (5) Allocation requirements for Followers: $200 for .01 lot sizes, $1000 for .05 lots, etc.

I follow beautiful trends. I trade EURUSD,USDCHF,USDJPY. I put the stop-loss at certain distance from the entry point. And, I trail the stop-loss. But, when the beautiful trend finishes, I close the position. There is nothing for it. I take the profit at target point. I use computer automatic trade system.
Ape strategy has the aim to get steady and constant pips over the time. My strategy is based on short and medium term trading on the main currency pairs by avoiding the exotic ones. Steady pips means also low drawdown which is possible because of my years of experience in stock and forex trading. Try me !


The strategy is based on a combination of systems. Manual trading. Using technical and fundamental analysis. Intraday, swing and position trading. Hedging, scalping, locking, stop-loss, trailing stop, orders. Don't forget, Forex trade has high risk. Invest only that money which loss won't be fatal. The risk is good when it is calculated.

Sustained profits in Forex trading are elusive, but exploitable inefficiencies do exist. The key is first identifying those inefficiencies as they appear and then recognizing when they're no longer exploitable. Our quantitative trading start-up has tailor-made this strategy for Zulu followers, with an eye on the high accuracy and well-managed risk that followers demand. Developed by our in-house quantitative mathematicians, this proprietary strategy targets exploitable price cycles in the three major currency pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY) in order to take small volatility-based profits from within larger price moves. The strategy will open up to a max of 3 positions per trade, however as there are several algorithms in operation at once, the strategy may at times have up to 3 trades (i.e. 9 positions total) open at once on a given currency pair, with each trade having it's own entry and exit logic. The large, visible SL's are for emergency purposes only; actual SL's are handled internally, meaning they are not visible to the broker or the Zulu platform, however reversals in trade entries will in most cases mean losing trades will be closed before hitting their SL. No martingale, grid or averaging down strategies are used.

Hello! This trading system is auto, the considered section input data for the calculation will be the value of the moving average, or more precisely, the difference between adjacent lines of readings. If the current value of the average greater than the previous value, the difference between the readings is added to the power of bulls, bull bars and the number increases by one. Regardless of the type of bar that corresponds to the current value of the moving average. Only 3 positions to open, max 1 on each currency.

05/05/2015: Before entering a trade make sure that your settings according to which I have suggested, it's 1 micro lot for each $ 450. You can increase the lot size if you already understand how this system works. If you use other signal providers, you will need additional capital according to what they suggest. If you miscalculate here then you might get a margin call, and if that happens then the next trade will not open and you will not get a chance to recover your capital, it would be a bad ending. Loss is better than letting a wrong calculation. if you lose then you only need another position to recover, but if you let a wrong calculation, then you need another capital to recover, it's a big difference. So manage your account properly. For now I am still interested in the GBPJPY pair, but I have not found the setup to enter the trade, they seem to be stuck in this range, and this looks interesting for me. I will wait for this ...

Cari follower, come si può chiaramente vedere, da fine febbraio non ho più operato. Questo perchè ho voluto prendermi una pausa di riflessione e studio. Credo infatti sia necessario migliorare aspetti fondamentali per poter essere veramente profittevoli in modo costante e duraturo, come disciplina, money management, gestione del rischio, e selezione delle operazioni. L'obiettivo che mi pongo è quello di avere una strategia solida a 360°, cosa che finora non è stato. A presto quindi con tante belle novità.

Sorry for bad entries, but when this method have a 100 pips stop loss, usually there is a very strong movement in the other direction, that let me have a gain that cover the loss and much more, just let run positions, target 150 pips. target 197.2.
Strategy robot use moving averages and binary count candlestick. Sometimes the robot changes the volume for a better use of the strategy, does not mean it can not be used in fixed mode. For initial mini 0.1 volumes no need of $ 1,000 in an account as collateral drowdown. Not to say that will be used, and will not be, but it is always good there is a margin well. For initial volumes mini 0.01 $ 200 in account to their safety.

Low volatility and price contained within a range on EURUSD. Few good signals on other pairs. I expect market conditions to improve in the following weeks, and especially with the new month of September. I'll continue to take only the best signals because the safety of my follower's funds is my top priority.

That is our goal - to find the accumulation zone, this zone can be described as - create a certain level of support, the level of interest in which a large buyer or seller. observe the behavior of prices (search repulsed or penetration level) and just join the movement of prices. 15min, 1h, 4h, 1d Alligator, Fractals, MA:200, RSI Период 22

I use the EA variety, we are profitable overall. As they good EA in the back test and forward test, without being seized with human emotions, you can expect a good grade. In addition, it has a neat stop loss setting, it is not hit by a large drawdown. I will replace them in the future EA.

No Auto/Bot only Elliott Wave with Daily Candle Stick formation is applied in my strategy. Max four position open at same time in only two Euro Crosses EUR/JPY AND EUR/NZD. I am running this strategy for only those who grow their capital gradually not fortnight. So I advise that only 2 percent of equity use for all four trades. i.e. (you use 1% with EURJPY and 1% EURNZD). If you have 1000$ equity than lot select for EURJPY is half mini (0.005) and same with EURNZD. I will try my best to gain maximum profit with limited draw-down. GoodLuck.

Good morning traders and investors EUR/USD is a little stubborn the last couple of days, but it will come down eventually. Technically, on the 4 hr and Daily chart the pair is reaching strong resistance levels. Fundamentally, earlier this morning Chinese Caixin Service rose to 52.4 (good data for USD), and last night FOMC Member George again said the Us data is strong enough for further rate increases this year, and in contrast, Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, repeated Mario Draghi's view's of the Monetary policy stance and more easing to be implemented in March. With all that said, please be patient with the current positions...Regards KINGS

Отлично! Лед тронулся! На следующей неделе ожидаю продолжения удорожания доллара США. Нам это только на руку :)
Review complete: Fundamental reasons for taking trades will be unchanged, management of trades altered significantly. The goal is to end the recent series of good trades going bad, new trades will be in two halves one with a smaller target and the other with the usual long target. Stop loss is being reduced and will be different for each pair, stop loss will move as the trades progress. Hopefully with continued careful trade selection and the new trade management procedure we can return to profitable trading.

Yesterday we once again saw some solid data out of the US. Lets see what happens with the China situation, and if Mario Draghi and the ECB steps in with more measures, as for EUR/USD is getting to levels above 1.15, which is much too strong for them at this time.. Regards
I have been trading the markets for more than 5 years and I have gained a lot of experience. I have learned that the best is to let the profits run and cut the losses. I do not do scalping. My trading is manual, technical, fundamental and intuitive and I always use a stop loss. Usually big winning series are followed by losing ones. The strategy will do better when the markets move and have volatility and perform badly when the markets become stagnant. Besides, the win/loss ratio will be sort of 5:, so we have to expect a lot more losses than wins, which I know most people can not stand. The stop loss size will vary from 30 to 80 or more pips depending on the pair. I will be trading gbpusd, usdjpy, audusd, gbpjpy, gbpaud, cadjpy and audjpy. If trading microlots (0.01) the account should not be less than 400$. Preferably more than 500. We should be very happy if we make 15% per year as average Suerte

GBPUSD added to traded pairs.
After years of experimentation I have improved my trading strategy and now feel confident that money can be made in this market consistently but there is no short cut. This system will make money consistently and without large drawdowns. The trade is made towards the trend and at major support/resistance levels.

October ended and in this month as you see in my performance I gained +1756 pips (monthly PnL include unrealized PnL) but many of my followers lost, why ? because in the first of month I lost ant they left but in the end of October with a good movement in GBP/JPY I recovered all of them and even +1756 in profit. they lost because they had not enough patience !!!!!
Good morning traders and investors. As you can see , I have adjusted my trading strategy the last month, opening between two and 8 positions.. working our position back into the ranks.., and trading only major pairs like EUR/USD...... EUR/USD found support around 1.10, and US data not so good these days... Regards KINGFXX

Good time! I trade only most liquid and predictable pairs. The trading method is manual and always mean diligent analysis of tech indicators: ADX, RSI, ATR, price action patterns. The described method of recognizing the trend and join the flat with another method - define the boundaries of the horizontal channels. Each section of the flat, as the lateral movement of the price forms a relatively narrow horizontal channel, the output of which is at the start of a trend and will be showing the exact entry time.

This is an automated system where the trades are placed at turnaround points in expectation of a favourable move according to the main trend. Trades are held until the trend is confirmed. Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) are monitored by the system, they are adjusted permanently, so when the apparent TP and SL are equal to zero, this means they are calculated by the system.
dear followers,do not close trades in negative. i don't do scalp trading,trades i make are usually medium term trades that may last couple of days or a week or two. every trade i open has a very sound fundamental and technical background to earn large amount of pips.kindly comment your queries/doubts before taking any action.
I wish all follower a happy new year.
Sorry for the last two months and the big DD. It was chaos in the news, indicators and currency markets, in general. Begining today I will be fully dedicated to my new system of trading, in order to make constant profit. My strategy is to trade only the EURUSD pair. Maximum 6 positions at the same time. I use a variety of algorithms, indicators and I pay attention to the big news, macroeconomic indicators, crowd psychology, behavioral economics and interest rates impact on the markets. I hope you like my trading style! Support Arkhimedes.

Hello Dear My Followers: I'm sorry to close positions I apologize to all of you.. I close positions because Eur/Usd go 1.13 and 1.14 there are possibilities level. Do not worry losses to be recovered. Thank you very much for your understanding and support.
Price action trading. I mostly focus on 4 hour charts on major currency pairs. My method is based on finding price action patterns which, at the right price, will give me statistical advantage to succeed on particular trade. Also, I try to keep Risk:Reward ratio at least of 1:1,5. Your risk settings: You should not risk of more that 0,05 lot (5000 currency units) per 1000 EUR account balance at first. If you feel comfortable, you might increase your risk up to 0,1 Lot per 1000 EUR.

After years of experimentation I have improved my trading strategy and now feel confident that money can be made in this market consistently but there is no short cut. This system will make money consistently and without large drawdowns. The trade is made towards the trend and at major support/resistance levels.
My strategy is lgma vs sma-cross ( laguerre vs simple moving average-cross ) When the fast lgma crosses above the slow sma,I will place long. Then at the reasonable profits,I will exit the trade. For stoploss should be low drawdown. When the fast lgma crosses below the slow sma,I will place short. Then at the reasonable profits,I will exit the trade. For stoploss should be low drawdown. This will bring profits to all the valued followers.

Dear followers: Good signals are tried well.Thanks
Мне кажется, что просто ограничивать убытки stop loss не совсем разумно. Эта система может долго набирать позицию, и вы будете терять на ограничении. Гораздо правильнее если вы применяете ограничения - дождаться, когда система наберёт 10 - 15 позиций и только потом входить, и ставить stop loss. Но следует что все это риски и вмешиваясь в алгоритм вы можете как понизить риск, так и повысить риск. Кто вам мешает поставить 0,01 / 100 депозита? Тогда алгоритм будет работать как в оригинальной идее.

Our analyzes are based mainly on the theory of Elliott Wave, also in the RSI and Slow Stochastic indicators in order to create synergies and opportunities presented to us in the market and thus succeed. However, in the last few weeks we have seen a lot of nervousness in the market caused by bad reported in the Eurozone outcomes and the falling price of oil, generating high speculation investors, therefore we will be prudent in the new management positions with stop.

Salve a tutti! Il mio metodo di lavoro e semplice, basato sullla lettura del grafico. Avremmo sempre un stop loss e take profit e stop di tempo. Se volete traddare con i miei segnali vi consiglio di usare al massimo 1 % dal capitale. Che Dio ci benedica! Buon trading a tutti!

Dear followers, just to update my status, the strategy is working very well and safe. Good trades for everyone!

i try to minimise risk and place stop loss in every trade i make (usually around 100 pips) so you all know what to expect at any given time. expect a lot of trades when i feel confident. I advise sizing down until you feel at ease 0.1L per 1000$ would do the trick. Last but not least, i advise that you size down in order to follow all my trades rather than place more lots in less trades. This way you will have the full profit of any movement, I wish us all good trades and profits

Dear followers, please, follow all my trades on all currenciese with equal positions. And I can ensure you that you have profit in the end of the month.

19.11. Уважаемые подписчики. На NZD/USD, на недельном графике свечная модель Утренняя звезда.
My strategy is basic trading style which follows the short term trend. The signal is made by my original indicator. I don't use limit. It takes profit by closing position according to my original indicator or stop out. The length of starting stop loss will be different each time. It depends on the market circumstances. The maximum stop length is 150pips. It will take up to 2 positions at the same time for each currency. I use EA(MT4) which runs on M30 chart to send the signal.

Many of my subscribers do exactly this among my list of strategies. There are no guarantees, consult your financial adviser and use only risk capital. I appreciate your business. Regards

Pound gapped down almost across the board as the week opened. The Yen has been showing strength against the euro and pound but weakness against the NZD and AUD.

Be patient .
Stayed out of the market most of this week because of the FOMC meeting so I missed out on the JPY trades. Honestly I'm not sure I would have been on the right side of any of those trades as I was thinking the JPY would probably gain back a little ground. So didn't make much on the week but didn't lose any either. Tracking account is within a few pips of all time highs, hopefully next week will set a new high water mark. Have a good weekend, Gary

My trading system is based on the commercially available technical analysis in various time frames. We work with TP and SL. We are always working to improve the system and will continue to test other currency pairs. Please think about their money management. I wish you all good luck and success.
Разрешите представить систему торговли на валютном рынке Форекс. Система основана на базовых постулатах торговли валютами которые часто применяются ведущими участниками рынка. Система мультивалютная, но в силу правил и ограничений ресурса на этом счёте торговля ведёться только на GBR/CHF. На нашем реальном счету пар больше. Стратегия среднесрочная, позиции могут удерживаться от 15 минут до пары месяцев, в зависимости от ситуации. Если Вы хотите торговать внутри дня то эта стратегия не для Вас.

The maximum stop loss for every trade is 100 pips and it is never modified after the trade is open. We recommend you to allow 3 or 5 open trades at the same time with lower leverage rather than allowing a single high leverage trade. We do so because our system usually performs much better when signals are so strong that allow more than one trade at the same time
The trade is based on Technical analysis and confluence. To minimize the risk the maximum open positions will be 7. The most important is the steady growth. Money management is the key to keep the profit and not give it back to the market. Most of the entries will be a limit order. Discipline and discipline wait for the market.
This Strategy trades the major currency pairs. I will Day Trade and Swing Trade. Stops are used on all positions. I will manually adjust the stops when I feel appropriate. This strategy may be classified as aggressive relative to Forex. Be diversified and use only risk capital. I believe this may be an excellent vehicle for subscribers to participate and have exposure to Forex. I believe a 3 - 6 month time frame should be a minimum for any strategy. My goal is to try to make this a top rated strategy that maximizes profits, establish good gains for the amount of risk taken and be consistent as possible. The above is a goal not a guarantee. I would like to have my Subscribers accepting Signals for the Long Term. I very much appreciate your business。

I'm good at short-term trading，I follow a set of excellent performance of the trading system, through long-term exploration and test: (1) analysis model is unique and effective (2) strict risk control (the largest floating loss points control in 200 points) (3) emotional control strictly, please supervise me.I will be happy to serve you.
Investment example : Initial deposit is $250 . Suggest one individual account with $250 to follow this signal , it means the risk just $250 only to join this plan . The trading size setting is 0.5 mini lot per trade with $250 balance . Once the balance increased $50 , then increase the trading size 0.1 mini lot . When the balance is $1000 the trading size is 2.0 mini lots . Base on the LOW DRAWDOWN , and the trading size adjustments on weekly . The equity will be increased to over $60000 within two years . It seems incredible , but it is achievable . 投資 250 美元,變為 6 萬美元的方法: 本金 $250 , 開始每一張單交易量為 0.5 迷你手 , 當本金達到 $300 , 將交易量增至 0.6 迷你手 , 本金每增加 $50 , 將交易量提升 0.1 迷你手 , 當本金達到$1000 , 交易量提升至 2.0 迷你手 , 根據此方法調整交易手數 , 約一至二年內 , 本金將可達到6 萬美元 .

Hi! 4 years trading experience. The basic strategy is scalping-intraday. Rarely leaving open positions on the next day. In my work are taken into account many factors, mainly technical and graphical analysis. Always use a stop-loss. Creative approach, SL is flexible. In my work use only our own indicators and advisers (experts). Advisor to use for tracking and closing positions. I opened the transaction is always by hand. Those who want to follow me, I recommend to start with a demo account in order to determine the volume oftrade. I usually does not enter more than 10% of the deposit. Good luck!

Движение продолжается, позиции пирамиды держим. Немного буду обновлять позиции, но в целом все по старому
The strategy provides for profit in the long term. The strategy allows a large number of open positions in the long term, so please use a minimum lot size and allow all trades. In general, one side open positions amount not more than 15. Per year on average earned 15000 pips profit. Trading currency pair is GBP/AUD.
Utilizo herramientas de indicadores técnicos como ADX en frames de 4 Horas para detectar entradas a tendencias en el par GBP/JPY, STOPLOSS de 77 pips, PROFIT de 283 pips todo a través de la plataforma automatica de zulutrade mediante scripts programables, garantizo aperturas los dias claves como los miercoles, tengo rendimientos en los test del 67% y maximo 5 operaciones con perdidas consecutivas.

I am expert in statistics and algorithmic trading. I optimized this strategy during one and a half year. It is a further developed grid with dynamically changing intervals and two baskets. This strategy is not purely technical, I observe the news concerning EUR and CHF USD daily. The system is optimized for a maximal profit vs. drawdown ratio.
The system is daily trade and the result will show by end of the day or next days .To avoid the high cost of these systems, I will have a stop loss and the stop loss will be timely. Meaning if take profit not triggered, the same day or at the end of the next day trading will be closed with profit or loss. *Expect more profit on daily trade (one trade each day compare to one trade each week). Maximum of 4 positions may be opened at the same time. Open trades are monitored around the clock.Thank you.

strategy is the daily technical and fundamental analysis based on the position opening. EUR GBP USD JPY CHF AUD NZD CAD. The goal is usually given as 10 - 200 pips. Allow me lots 30 micro opening position. I do not like to lose! I expect the rate of 100% profitable trades! Just like any open positions, which will be delivered! I hope at the end of each month are calculated with money.

But each asset at a certain period is, the sequence of closures spark capable of generating Pulses (trend). Ie overcome local volatility. In fact, this directional change in the direction of buying or selling prices. How would push in a certain direction. Specifically for this dnevok 3 days rising / falling with each closing above the previous high (for growth), minimum (for the fall). An important condition that the pulse travels with minima or maxima of the month. And should not be redeemed, that is the last candle in the pulse should not have blocked the closing retrograde. (one allowed).

My new investment strategy; Under fundamental analysis, judgment-based,reference technical indicators to operate. Each time positions 1-6,stop loss and win will make decisions based on the actual market situation. I will pay particular attention to risk control. Also, under uncertain circumstances i will reduce operations, or even stop the operation. When the situation is more clear, I will be relatively more radical. I hope that through our joint efforts to achieve a win-win.

have been trading Forex for 9 years, this strategy depends on the change in the market volatility, each position has a definite S.L and T.P,normally i have six open positions but in some cases it may be little higher, so please allow 10 open positions . use a proper M.M, and I suggest a one micro lot for each 250$,I wish a best of luck for all of you.
The system is daily trade and the result will show by end of the day or next days up to a profit. *To avoid the high cost of these systems, I will have a stop loss and the stop loss will be timely. Meaning if take profit not triggered, the same day or at the end of the next day trading will be closed with profit or loss. Expect more profit on daily trade (one trade each day compare to one trade each week). Maximum of 4 positions may be opened at the same time. Open trades are monitored around the clock. *Welcome to all investors!

As expected EUR/USD,continues to be down. Only event that can make a short term rally is Swiss intervention. Note that trading is not a one way journey ,so if you can't bear mild draw down,trading is not for you!!

This system is designed with the help of Elliot wave (Main Count) , Fibonacci Ratios and Trend lines. Stop loss is not more than 80 point while profit taking on different level. Entry is based on motive waves and exit the positions when trend line break. You are requested to run it on demo account before coming to live account. Good Luck
My target was to build a solid, fully automated strategy with as minimal drawdown as possible, but making consistent monthly profits. This strategy has amazing and consistent profits with low drawdown. It opens positions based on overbought/oversold market conditions combined with other indicators to get correct entries. It usually holds position for less than 48 hours thus reducing drawdown for your account. I recommend min deposit of $300 to trade my system.....Gowdar

Top Stocks, I'm a professional forex trader and what I've learnt after years of trading is that money and trades management are the key factor to succeed. Max 3 open position, SL < 100 pip, Break Even and Trailing Stop are used for every open trade. We don't like good trades turning into bad ones. Roll your snowball down the hill and watch it grow.
Guys & girls, i really truly appreciate your comments and value each and every one of them. Having that said, I must remind you it will never occur again, I'm just saying.that I do not pick pairs or entry levels on fundamentals. My picks are made from a series or graphs with my most weight on the fibonacci scale.
La estrategia consiste en usar el análisis técnico para aprovechar las correcciones que se generan en un tendencia y entrar a comprar o vender según sea el caso, establecer stop loss cortos y respetarlos, aprovechar también resistencias y soportes para negociar si se ve una buena oportunidad, saludos a todos.
Hi everyone! I am a technical trader with 4 years experience in Zulu Trade, I use classic SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE, trend lines and channels. My entries are very well studied and I will open positions protected in an area where the setup is invalidated. My chart studies are taken in many time frames, but I use only setups in 4h and D1.Maximum stop 120 pips(the ideal stop I think) We moved on these new accounts with a safer strategy where you can increase lots and profits.Usualy 5 positions opened but sometimes when we descover a sweet spot we ride the market

Important: 1) In order to be in profit you have to allow all 4 open trades; 2) Do not place your own take-profits and stop-losses (especially if they are less than the daily volatility of the EURUSD pair). All open trades are monitored around the clock and our real take-profits and stop-losses are not visible, are constantly recalculated (the ones that you see do not match the real); 3) Zulutrade statistical parameter Necessary Minimum Equity means how much capital is required in order to follow with 0.1 Mini Lots (=0.01 Standard Lots, =1 Micro Lots) all Max Open Trades of a Trader. That is, in our case in order to follow all 4 open trades with 0.1 Mini Lots you only need $222.81; or for example, to follow with 0.5 Mini Lots need 5 * $222.81 = $1114.05; or for example, to follow with 1.0 Mini Lots need 10 * $222.81 = $2228.1; and so on..

Dear followers, due to recent move of the Swiss National Bank to lift the cap of the Swiss franc against the euro, and the related exceptional volatility and extreme lack of liquidity as result unfortunately affected my trading demo account with Alpari UK. As a result, at this point of time trading can not be performed at my ZuluTrade Provider account. So trading activity at this account will be closed, but soon I begin trading on real account assosiated with Zulutrade. You are welcome to my new account. Уважаемые последователи. Недавнее решение Швейцарского национального банка снять ограничение в отношении швейцарского франка по отношению к евро, и связанной с этим исключительной волатильности и крайней нехватки ликвидности и банкротства Alpari UK, к сожалению, повлияло на мой Демо-счет с Альпари Великобритании. В результате, серверы Alpari UK прекратили свою работу, и торговля на данном счете, связанном с Zulutrade не может быть продолжена. Однако в ближайшее время будет открыт новый реальный счёт, и торговля на нём будет продолжена по той же успешной стратегии. Приглашаем всех присоединяться к новому счёту.

Trading spot currencies involves substantial risk and there is always the potential for loss. Your trading results may vary. Because the risk factor is high in the foreign exchange market trading, only genuine “risk” funds should be used in such trading. If you do not have the extra capital that you can afford to lose, you should not trade in the foreign exchange market.

I had a lot of knowledge from foreign exchange, so I have officially participated in ZuluTrade to make money with all of you. Of our business strategy include the basics such as stoc, Fibonacci, Ichimoku ... My strategy interested in low-risk, and profit-seeking stable monthly to investors. You see I made pips.

Max. Drawdown 600 pips.
Dear friends, the choice of a signal provider please pay attention to such factors as the maximum drawdown in points, the maximum number of open trades, the worst and the best deal in points, the average profit at points on the transaction and the total profit in points, but so also should pay attention to the slippage of a broker.Thank you.
The MACD and RSI indicators are showing the pair in oversold conditions, I will maintain the positions to anticipate the reversal, if this does not happen, I will cancel order if they hit -200 pip. Stay positive.

I use the EA variety, we are profitable overall. As they good EA in the back test and forward test, without being seized with human emotions, you can expect a good grade. In addition, it has a neat stop loss setting, it is not hit by a large drawdown. I will replace them in the future EA.
This strategy is based on Price Acton and RSI.hi all,i just use manual trading based on special criteria i developed it mainly depend on the price action and behavior near the entry point .in a trending market the position will not take long time to hit the target in a side-way market it may took days to hit the target or the stop. i watch closely my positions. i cant guarantee there will be no losses but i will make sure these lose is to its minimal .good luck to you all and to myself to achieve your target and goals.

I passionatly look foward to trading and I love every minute of it. I plan to trade charts and fundemental news with a resonable stop loss. My financial experience is I worked on Wall Street as a proprietary trader for 3 years before trading my own capital. All trades are discretionary and you can loose money on any trade. Use your lots wizely and do not use to much leverage because that could end up with massive losses.
more
This is my proprietary system that continuously looks for opportunities with multiple currency pairs and quickly detects the strength/weakness of currencies. The system mostly exploits the exhaustion of trend in higher time-frames, tats, but some times it takes time to accumulate profits due to the nature of the Forex market. So please be patient when following my system, and try it for at least a month to see reasonable profits. To maximize profits, you shouldn't set your own SL or TP levels, but it is up to you. Please also make sure you allow all my trades to open. Regarding lot allocation, you may allocate 1 micro-lot for every $X balance shown by Necessary Minimum Equity, where 1 micro-lot = 0.1 mini-lot = 0.01 standard lot. It is a fully manual system based on various indicators.

I'm good at short-term trading，I follow a set of excellent performance of the trading system, through long-term exploration and test: (1) analysis model is unique and effective (2) strict risk control (the largest floating loss points control in 140 points) (3) emotional control strictly, please supervise me.I will be happy to serve you
Going into the ECB event,there is potential for +300 pips in downside and 150-200ish on upside. Given the anticipation of euro bears,it is not hard to disappoint them triggering a relief rally to 1.24-25. I will be keeping an eye on the event before resuming short EU trade. I would like to say do allocate lots keeping in mind only 1 (max 2) lots are opened. So,if you allocate 1 lot to normal traders who open 3-5 trades,you have to allocate 3-4 lots here. Stoplosses are kept keeping in mind the fundamental news,how price reacts to levels rather than fixed 50 or 80 or 100 pips.

The strategy is very simple but not so much that would be a lose. Sometimes I lose but overall rates of return do not allow to take care of this. All decisions are made only in the most rational circumstances, mainly using the most common technical analysis and fundamental plus an inner conviction. In the subsequent decision may change only if there is a real threat.
I am a full time trader. I use my own methodology and indicators worked up over many years of trading all the different markets including Currencies, Futures, Commodities and Stocks. This Strategy trades the major currency pairs. I will Day Trade and Swing Trade. Stops are used on all positions. I will manually adjust the stops when I feel appropriate. This strategy may be classified as aggressive relative to Forex. Be diversified and use only risk capital. I believe this may be an excellent vehicle for subscribers to participate and have exposure to Forex. I believe a 1 - 4 month time frame should be a minimum for any strategy. My goal is to try to make this a top rated strategy that maximizes profits, establish good gains for the amount of risk taken and be consistent as possible. The above is a goal not a guarantee.

I think after today's NFP some USD strength can be predicted. I will look for selling opportunities in NZDUSD, AUDUSD, CADUSD. GBP correction should end soon - I will try to establish GBPCAD or GBPNZD long positions. That's the preliminary plan for next week. At least for now.

Will trade with trend most of the time, but if suddenly trend reverses i will be using grid against the trend the lots will be in incremental format . may open 3 to 13 positions. but always in profit. please copy all the positions to get profit. The trade will be opened for atleast 2 to 3 days. Copy all the positions will make ur account in profit. Allow minimum 13 positions in worst case scenario. mostly gbpusd. plz use smaller lot sizes.

The system is daily trade and the result will show by end of the day or next days up to a profit. *To avoid the high cost of these systems, I will have a stop loss and the stop loss will be timely. Meaning if take profit not triggered, the same day or at the end of the next day trading will be closed with profit or loss. *Expect more profit on daily trade (one trade each day compare to one trade each week). *Maximum of 4 positions may be opened at the same time. Open trades are monitored around the clock. *Welcome to all investors!

This is weekly trading strategy. Some trades I will keep 1 day till 2 weeks.Stop loss will be less than 100% daily ATR, average 80 pips. My main strategy is developed using Elliotte waves, Fib levels,, price action. I will trade using major currency pairs.I will try to have excellent risk reward ratio.
Our trade system is basically Day-trade and trend following. Maximum open positions is 5. We hold only one position per currency. Tight stop loss for open positions will be less than 70 pips for one position. We mainly trade USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, AUS/JPY NZU/JPY EUR/USD, EUR/GBP etc. Our winning average is not so high because we aim for big profit but small loss. But don't worry about it. In the end,(weekly and monthly basis) you can get steady profit. Therefore, please do not increase your lot size even if we are on a winning streak. If you want to increase your lot size, please do that from next month. We try to do our best for all the people who support us.

Уважаемые инвесторы, просьба учитывать высокую волатильность валютной пары GBP/NZD. На одну сделку выделяйте не более двух процентов от Вашего депозита, тогда в конечном итоге не будет большой просадки.
Торгуем по трем валютным парам, количество открытых позиции одновременно зависит от ситуации по валютных парах на даный момент с обязательным применением стоп лосса. Просадка зависит от того по какому тайфрейму в даной ситуациии открывается сделка. Предпочтение отдается на работе с тайфреймами м5,м15 но в некоторых случаях возможно открытие позиций и по тайфрейму н4,н1. Желаю всем успешной торговли и увеличения собственных депозитов.

GBP is going down in short term.

Genel olarak EURUSD gibi paritelerde işlem açıyorum. AUDUSD,NZDUSD,GBPUSD de favorileim arasındadır. istikrarlı bir yönteme sahibim . teknik analiz kullanıyorum ve dar ama kesin aralıkları yakalamaya çalışıyorum. en fazla 4 aynı anda 4 işlem açıyorum. çogunlukla bekleyen emir kullanıyorum böylesi zulutrade için daha sağlıklı. stoploss u gerektigi ölçüde az koymayı hedefliyorum fakat duruma göre bazen artacaktır. ama sorun yaraatmayacak bir biçimde artacaktır. umarım hep birlikde bol kazançlar elde edeceğiz .

New year! New tweaks to the strategy! Stay tuned.
We are more focused on our performance at the end of the month than having an ultra high success ratio. So if a trade turns against us, we will cut it loose instead of holding it until price comes back so we can exit with a small profit. This strategy is followed by others, but it is short sighted and can lead to large losses.Hedging is possible. Over the last 30 years, we have learned that we cannot predict the future with certainty. But with a good strategy, risk management and money management, it is possible to earn superior returns over time. Put our experience to work and join us in this adventure as we navigate the global FX market. Good day, and good trading!

26/5/2015: Sorry for delayed update. It's been quite busy in recent days, but I had all positions under control. We didn't break our -6000 pips DD promise, we didn't break our 20 open positons promise, we didn't break our -300 pips SL (per trade) promise. We maybe don't deliver +2000 pips profit every month, but we are definitely not the ones, who break promises. You can rely on that. °°°°°°°°°°°°°° We should get NEW HIGH very soon. Consistency and slow growth is what matters the most. Thank you. Z.

We are the experts in statistics and algorithmic trading. WE optimized this strategy during 2014. It is a further developed grid with dynamically changing intervals. This strategy is not purely technical, I observe the news concerning EUR pairs on daily basis. The system is optimized for a maximal profit vs. lowest possible drawdown ratio. Max. open positions is 20 (very rarely though) and max. SL per one trade is -300 pips. So set your lot size according to that and you'll be safe.

we expect to see more selloffs on the pounds as the fisrt quarter of the year progresses..

Dear Followers. In my trading, I use the EURUSD and GBPUSD. This strategy allows you to get quite a good profit with moderate drawdown. But to protect the deposit, I recommend not to raise the volume. For relaxed trade I recommend to use 0.01 lot for every $250-300 in your account. For an aggressive trade, you should have at least $150 in the account.
Hi guys ! Sorry for the break :(. It is unavoidable and personal. I suffered lot for the past 5 months. But now its time to say i am back with more power;). I will be online in two accounts ( twentytwenty20 and ultraecobala). Thank u all !!

ma strategié est basée sur les etapes suivantes 1) je trade pas chaque jours ,je trade seulement si il y a un bon signal. 2)j'ai utilise tjrs le stoploss pour minimisé les pertes 3) je suis tres patient peut etre dans un semaine je trade pas parce que il n'y a pas de bon signal .mais du que j'ai trouve le bon signal je trade . 4) je trade seulement sur les trades qu'ont une possibilité de réussite de 90%.
Review of my Zulutrade public profile: This a trading system designed to maximize profits without increasing Drawdown. The model is tuned on regular basis in order to obtain the best possible perfomance. All trades by will placed with a stoploss of no more than 100 pips. Risk warning: Tading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk. Before deciding to participate, you should carefully consider your level of leverage. Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose. Thanks for following and good luck!

No matter what it is. I must comply with my steel general trading rules, believe me, this is a reliable trading system, which has more than 67% of the winning!
My signals have TP, SL, and everyone have an account follows my signal should know that, Please, make sure you use 10% maximum from your total balance. I talked about that because anytime when the market targets our stop loss we start talking, how come?. Any financial market worldwide have both ways you won some and loss some. However, if you check my signal you will found the won orders more than the loss orders that mean not every time the market go anti-us we start crying, we fighters front a wild market.

This system is very simple, only using price action and a few basic indicators to make technical analysis. The system will spot direction of the 5M trend and follow it. maximum 10 trades open at the same time. Better you lower your lots than limit the maximum trades, because we don't know which trade will be loss and which trade will be profit. Thank you.
My strategy is mainly based upon market direction regarding support and resistance observation in 15m, 30m, and 4h. I could open until 8 orders but more frequently 4 at the same time. Orders are opened manually and closed automatically with various number of pips. I try to maintain a 110/50 ratio in profit/loss.Thank you！
I want to reduce my drawdown is its why I target 1 to 10 Pipes
На счете работают 2 торговые системы, максимальное количество одновременно открытых сделок 2. Рекомендую следующие настройки: 0.05Lot на 1000 $, максимум 0.1Lot на 1000 $.


This strategy involves following Abcd pattern ,Gartley Pattern,Bat Pattern ,,crab Pattern,,and 3 drive pattern to maximise the winning ratio . Will certainly look into short term and long term charts to identify those patterns and give priority to long term pattern build ups as they are more reliable . Good luck T

May 11th 2015 9:12 PM EST Update for April of 2015 to DATE We had a firm up on Oil as we have headed over $ 60 BBL Netting a total Loss of - 2787 PIPS for the month . We had no choice but to slowly sell our positions for a month end loss equal almost to our prior months gains of 2859 NET Closed PIPS. Over all the year remains positive to our strategy and we will quickly be back on track to close up and come ahead this month also. As of today's date and time we have closed many profitable trades to be down only a total of -102 PIPS for the month. We should close the month with a NET positive PIP count. FXRUNNERS

This Account is Long term trading by Price Action strategy with time frame 1D Some time we fix target, some time we let profit run ...As all of you know Forex is a highly risky market. Sometimes there are losses. They are part of trading, I 'll do our best every time. Thanks to all my followers and I`ll Do my best to support your confidence. We will do our best.
This is a swing trading system that trades in a higher time frame. Sometimes I can open more than one trade at a time as the case may be. My trades have a setting with a stop loss of plus or minus 100 pips; although I suggest a standard stop loss of 200 pips for each open trade so as to protect your account in case of a big draw down. I don’t have a fixed take profit but only takes my profit when a particular trend finishes. Because it is a swing trading system, my open trade(s) can last for more than a day before I will take my profit. Thank you！

Price chart at higher time frames used to verify positions. Last modifications are applied since 13 October. The future will be better!

This is a trading system which follows the daily trend. I buy at low and sell at high. I am a single pair trader. I can open more than one trade at a time as the case may be. Personally I do not use take profit and stop loss settings, but for those who are used to it, I suggest and advice a take profit setting of 50-100 pips per trade and a standard stop loss setting of 200 pips so as to protect your account in case of a big draw down. My open trades can last for up to a day or more before I take my profit. So follow the signal and enjoy the ride. CHEERS!!!

This is an aggressive Forex trading strategy based upon a new generation, trade can open up to 25 best profit condition neural net driven trading trend which focuses purely on price action bringing together for the first time the work of two distinct development teams, each highly successful in their own right. This is a hybrid trend-based strategy. It identifies potential short- term trend acceleration points by means of a proprietary procedure which calculates the entry point based on the currency pair's volatility. This strategy typically enters the market based on a) a strong price movements and b)over-extended price levels against the short-term trend. During trending markets it may undergo a series of losses and suffer some drawdown.

The strategy is based on finding momentum in the market and scalping the momentum to book quick profits. Various Indicators are used like moving averages and momentum to find the best trade. Trades could be open in both the directions to hedge against the market fluctuations. Please follow Zulu recommendations for account management.
My system based on 3 EA, each EA was tested in 11 years history, working together on EURUSD pair only but on different time frames and different strategy's: 1st based 2 indicators and also support and resistance lines. 2nd based 3 indicators. Max around 2 trades in the same time, some times positions will be opening for more than one day. The strategy works with relatively medium leverage and medium risk. I trade with long profits (180-250pips).

GAIN906834F, thanks for following. Sorry the last couple of trades did not work out. I look at the short therm trend which is just a small window before news hit so the movement of the last couple days is not part of the system (this follow the strategy stated). As not staying long enough for the sell position, I have made small modification where I will close at breakeven when is going back down which indicate losing momentum - off course the trade could turn back and would have made good profit have it not been closed but that is the price of being safer. Sometimes if it had no been close we would have ended up with a SL trade.

My strategy is about working hard for followers. Nothing is that much importat as working hard. I m doing 20-50% per month. If you want make big money just follow me and check this awesome ride. No autobots no robots just pure skills from 1 year of demo and 2 years of real trading.

Hello followers today on words I'm trading with my live account please follow my live account.
Technical analysis mostly but always on the lookout for news events as well. I use multiple charts to generate signals, entry and exit. Not so much trades in the month since i try to reduce risk. My goal is to always have a positive pips balance every month and to have very low drawdowns.
The markets are dynamic and are always changing; it’s important as a trader to keep up and adapt to change in these markets and look carefully to money management. When the market dynamics shift we need to adapt our Forex trading strategy to suit. The rewards will follow if we can react like a cat after falling from a height, landing on all fours. Adapt to market condition and never combat it. To be in profit try to follow all of my positions because my moto is ... There are only two kinds of losses: big losses and small losses, given these choices – always choose small losses.

Holiday break time now. Back at it in January. Happy holidays!


Dear followers, in my trading on the forex market, I use technical and fundamental analysis. Forex trading is associated with a high risk, especially intraday trading. Position will be opened on the basis of the trend in the middle and long-term trading. Since this gives a more stable positive result. Set up your trading account so that the each open position does not exceed 0.2 percent of the amount of your deposit. I constant monitoring of the market, as soon as a signal to buy or sell position will be opened with the stop loss and targets. For my followers Forex trading is not the primary job, so their main purpose of having a permanent and stable income. For more positive results, better if you to open all my trades, and not optionally. Good luck to you!

The system looks to provide entries yielding excellent opportunities for good monthly profit. All currencies will be traded depending on the pair with the highest probability of win, please ensure you follow all signals. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk. Variables such as the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses as well as maintaining adequate liquidity are material points which can adversely affect actual real trading results.

Hi Please note that this is a long term strategy . There aren't many clear entry points that promises a minimum of a 1-2 risk reward ratio. If all conditions for a entry are not there then i do not trade. The target of growing the account by 5% per month is still being reached after 13 months of difficult market conditions. That target remains my focus point.

dear followers ... starting from january 22 i will put my stops @ 260 on any trade taking into account such huge reversals that occured on the canadian dollar and cost me alot .... i expect to recover by the middle of february isa ..
This trader does not have an approved description yet.
Several people asked the legimitate question if I don't respect the EUR news, in this case Draghi's lowering of the interest rate yesterday. Yes, I was aware of this news, but, and that's the trick, the EUR news are much less important for this pair than the CHF news. So EURCHF made a reversal move, much stronger than e.g. the EURUSD.
Dear Followers! From now 15 Feb 2016, In my strategy max open trades are 8. And I only focus on this account (Planet 999) to make money for you. Thank you!
Hi everyone! I am a technical trader with 4 years experience in Zulu Trade, I use classic SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE, trend lines and channels. My entries are very well studied and I will open positions protected in an area where the setup is invalidated. My chart studies are taken in many time frames, but I use only setups in 4h and D1.Maximum stop 120 pips(the ideal stop I think) We moved on these new accounts with a safer strategy where you can increase lots and profits.Usualy 5 positions opened but sometimes when we descover a sweet spot we ride the market

In fundamental analysis, On the one hand to macro basic factors compared with predicted data and historical data, On the other hand To keep the basic factors in the global environment, At the same time also need to make a comprehensive analysis on various basic factors of change. Only a comprehensive, objective, system analysis, to improve the accuracy of fundamental analysis.
Rules... 1. Never chase 2. Never trust the first price. Anything can happen to the price movements, but one thing for sure - they always mislead you. Prices make news, not the other way around. A market is going to go where it is going to go. Price action trader. I hope for nice trades and nice profits. NEAR TO 150 PIPS PER TRADE MY STOP LOSS.
Tato investiční strategie je založena na opatrném obchodování na základě technické analýzy s předem stanovenými Stop Lossy, a to ve výši 100 pipů. Obchodování bude prováděno s více měnovými páry, ale pro každý měnový pár bude v jeden čas otevřen pouze jeden obchod. Celkový počet obchodů by se měl většinou pohybovat v rozmezí 1-10 obchodů současně. Rozložení mezi více měnových párů je zvoleno z důvodu snížení rizika.

This strategy is simple but thoroughly tested, the only thing you will have to do is follow the signals, let me do the work. Important is that you follow all signals and do not let yourself get stopped out. I will open more trades if I see opportunities, use wise money management when following!
After one week with no operations due to open positions, good trades came in the past three days. I continue to focus on GBP/AUD cross since it is keeping to be very volatile and the good profits can be easily made.
We closed an excellent day with lots of pips earned on GBP/AUD. Pound continued its downtrend started in this week and increased today on ECB expectations. We kept profits going and made some very short trading after Draghi's words.
Dear friends, I have opened a thread to try solve your questions here: http://forum.zulutrade.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=38352

Weekly Analysis: Approaching my long term support (Weekly Charts). I will be looking for good price action signals on daily or 4 hourly graphs. This is a very good place for a counter trend trades. We could potentially see a significant retrace higher. (Eur/Usd, Gbp/Usd, Usd/Chf, Aud/Usd, Nzd/Usd etc). Thank you for all your support. :)
Dear followers, trading in normal mode, currently the trading strategy has following setup, trading pairs - EURUSD, GBPUSD, NZDUSD, AUDUSD, USDCAD, USDJPY, maximum of open trades - 2, maximum stop-loss level tightened up to 150 pips., take profit target about 50-150 pips., in each trade. Average trade length, from 1 day to 1 week.
In my system i use daily weekly and monthly charts. Bollinger Band is my favorite indicator with price action candlesticks and looking always to sentiment indicators. Carefully to find the best entry and exit levels for my positions and determine the best currency pair and carefully my stop loss for each one of my positions. 16 positions maximum for some currencies pairs with stop loss near to 100pips for each one.
thank you for comment ....a lot more to come just a begining
Welcome back, there is no change. We have a very good start in this new year 2016. In January we were able to earn a very good profit.
Trading strategy based on the analysis of horizontal and vertical volumes. As a filter of the correct opening trades moving average is used. Deal closes force when changing the script or the appearance of the conditions for the reversal. Put take profit. Instead of stop Loos use the appearance of a signal in the opposite direction. Trades are opened at the end of the day.

Hi AAA464460F. Thanks for your comments. Next week 13.01.2014 year will change strategy and will include new currency pairs.

As all of you know Forex is a highly risky market. Sometimes there are losses. They are part of trading, but the purpose is to make more pips than we`ve lost. I`m confident that my strategy will bring you constant profit. Just You have to be patient even in bad trading days. Thanks to all my followers and I`ll Do my best to support your confidence.
I manually trade based on Price Action strategy. From the H1, H4 chart, I look for the best entry point. For ranging markets, my target is mostly around 10-250 pips, hopefully more. For trending markets, I hope to trail the stop loss until it is hit. A scalping trade could turn into a long-running trade. If the price breaches those trendlines, I use Fibonacci retracements until I can again draw support/resistance trend lines. Then when the trade is in enough profit,

Trade based on AT. I recommend the use of alpari brokers and leverage of 1:100. In one transaction risk 2-3% of the capital. I always use a Stop Loss. The minimum recommended capital to 0.01 lot is $200. My followers wish to earn a lot of money. Good luck ! ! !

to AAA1454710F: OK，Thank you
I have a system that constantly tries to forecast the future prices, and the risks associated with getting to those prices. To do this I use the MCS, and the GBM. The model is using history from the last month to predict future direction. Which means the system is always adapting and never stays the same, at least from month to . The system comes few possible outcomes, and I make the system choose the one highest probability. For this i use Excel spreadsheets and VB Script with formulas to come up with the most probable trade. Here I only trade 18 open positions, to keep dds to a minimuIf you feel I'm waiting too long to exit profitable trades, be my guest and close then sooner.

I have been trading in forex market long time with very good profits . I decided become a signal provider to share with you how it is possible to win in forex market . I developed my own system that is based in technical and fundamental analysis . I work with technical indicators such as RSI , STOCH , MACD , ADX , MOVING AVERANGE and pivot points . Hedging is also welcome ..Welcome all and good luck!

GBP/USD, 4H/1H, manual, without indicators - only price action, support and resistance levels. I trade only GBPUSD with supports/resistances and trend. I trade between 6:30am and 8:00pm UK time. I have more than one open trade per currency pair. Planned monthly gain 15% - 25%, which would double an account within 4-6 months.
Happy new year people..stay tune, trade small and gain big..usd is good invest for 2016, i wish you the best
After a period of exploration and practice,I have improved my own investment techniques and methods. I will adhere to the synthesized timing of transactions based on. Through market analysis, judgment, grasp the timing of the transaction, cautious and stable trading Major currencies;etc. Mainly 1-5 positions each time. I will stick to my strategy and discipline and strive to create a better tomorrow...:)

The strategy provides for profit in the long term. The strategy allows a large number of open positions in the long term, so please use a minimum lot size and allow all trades. In general, one side open positions amount not more than 15. Per year on average earned 15000 pips profit. Trading currency pair is USD/CAD.
5 years experience in forex trading ，Use Trend Trading Act and Fibonacci Exchange Act ! Used to intra-day trading, trade is given priority to with straight plate of currency pairs,Each trade may last from a few hours up to several weeks.We maximize the move while keeping the risk low by scaling into our positions in a single currency pair when value is recognized.All trades are monitored by us consistently and are based on a combination of technical and fundamental analysis.We will manually exit trades when we think it is appropriate in order to maximize profits and to provide proper risk management.

Price action trading working with candle sticks as well as ema and rsi has been most reliable and i will continue this strategy for now, Will try to trade pairs with small spreads, i try to control draw down and close trades quickly where possible working on the hourly but will check the daily and leave it open longer if it looks like it will come back in. Will watch out for news and avoid where possible. Don't like to gamble with risky trades so i wont over trade for the sake of it.

Use my own personal trading system and is based upon integrated,adaptive trend-system which analyse the currency price on 5 minute, 1 hour and 4 hour timeframes. The key is following the trend and using stop loss for capital protection. The key of success is control yourself and your position.Trade， 300 pips is yours. Investors, allowed to open up to 30 positions at once with a min. deposit of $1.000 for micro lots / 0.01. All important datails you find in our statistics..

Hi all The main strategy is to identify short-term range breakouts and to predict corresponding reversals. There are many people who already use it and have had extraordinary success. The results above are real and speak for themselves. EA aims for specific market conditions. If all conditions align the robot will make a trade. If conditions begin to subside, EA will close trades promptly to prevent losses. Robot work on eur/usd. Max open position its 5. Max stop loss 100pips but typical stop loss is 23 pips and average take profit its about 37 pips. Average trade per month its 5. Low risk and high reward. You can afford to lose a few trades and win only one, and still come out making money. My strategy its very safe and stable.

This strategy is based on a combination of support resistance levels and swing strategy. I trade in short and medium term. I trade mostly on major pairs and sometimes on cross pairs. I use tight stop loss, with profit/loss ratio 1:1. To maximize profit and minimize loss don't use your own profit and loss. Thanks for your attention
In our trading we use only mechanical trading systems of our own design tested on 10 years of history. EURUSD is the base currency. All systems from our protfolio have tight stops ( 50-80 pips ). Take profits targets are much greater. Most of the time we enter in a position with limit orders. We plan to post signals with moderate risk - from 1.75 to 2.2% per trade.
I have more than 3 years trading experience. I use technical, fundamental, graphical and statistical analysis. Very important thing for me the good risk/reward ratio, so take profits targets are much greater. My trading method is price action, and I always use a stop-loss. I opened the transaction is usually by hand. I'm fundamentally swing trader, but I like the day trading also.
I am trading with intraday strategy.I will consider Moving Average is the best way to analyze the trend and trade.I do safe and alertness trading.I do not believe in sentiment or feeling method.I believe in technical analysis.I want to tell you guys be aware that no one can predict or analyze the market 100%.So,my DD is worst for that.Each and every trade of mine is done with watchfully and studied ,but also not possible to avoid the DD.All trading strategies have both character of positive and negative qualities.Don't think that is best & this is best.All trading strategies are best when we utilize at proper way or method.Hope for better,think positive and prepare for action is my words.So,don't think too much for the result.Result may differ from your expectation.First of all prepare for yourself to be cool and patience,don't make hurry.Please avoid silly mistakes.You have to wait for good opportunity. Allways be a spectator.In the trade position is very important.
more
This is probably the simplest system you'll ever come across. Opening UPTO 30 trade at a time, my goal is to make as many pips as possible while keeping drawdown at a minimum. All trades have a tight stoploss and a takeprofit which may be adjusted from time to time when better opportunities present themselves. You should have atleast $1000 margin to follow my trades with a micro lot,$10,000 margin for mini lots, etc.
more
I am doing trend following. I trade with EUR/USD and GBP/AUD. GBP/AUD only short because of the interest. My trading style is nothing for ppl who are afraid of a high drawdown because sometimes it takes some time to change to the wright direction. The stopp loss will be 500.
I use usually a 50 pips stop loss. I'm a long term trader. I have 2 years of experience in Forex trading. I use M15, and 1H and 4H timeframe. I like day trading and swing trading too, so I use differents methods regarding the market conditions. You are welcome to follow me!

This is a new system, which was tested for 1 year, and the results are excellent.This is save system. Traded only one currency pair EUR / USD. The actual operation of the system is done by an expert advisor and produces a signal every 30 minutes.Stop Loss will be manually triggered by myself or automatically by the EA depending on conditions. Patience and good luck to all followers.

I average about 40 pips/months and my max drawdown on this period has been about 66 if im not mistaken. 30 pip's drawdowns now and then are not avoidable, and we will probably face higher dd in the future. I can't assure you I will make tons of pips, market is uncertain and noone knows what we can get from it tomorrow. However, I can promise I will never lose more than 35 pips/trade and I will do my best to make you some money. Now If you should stop following me or not, this is your own choice. AAA1339880F, thanks for the information, much appreciated. Regards

Dear friends, my trading system is mainly based on trend-based, does not appear to carry a single case, the total amount of not more than 1~10 single-single, total stop of less than 450 points, I can not guarantee that every month can be profitable, but annual income can be above 40%. Within 15% of each callback, set up your positions with a single proportion ($ 300 account with 0.02), please be patient to follow, thank you, good luck!

Our maximum open positions is 8, we don’t think make any changes strategy, thanks for your good comments.
Dear followers, if you don't like please unfollow. You don't give me chances, you give chance to your money. Its your fault if you don't study the stats. In the past sometime I have reached DD -800 pips. So, if you are sizing with mega lot sizes is your problem. If you don't feel comfortable losing 100 pips then you are risky and trading does not suit for you at all. If you cannot afford loosing 100 pips, I am sure in the future you are going to loose much money. Please take care of

由于讯息太多，判断失误给大家造成较大损失，对不起。我今后会用稳健的策略，控制仓位，并设置止损。我有多年的经验，优先保证资金的安全，再追求更大的利润。请大家多提建议，我们多交流，促进我的水平提高。我们的目标一定能达到。我还有一个账户zwwwaabb请大家一起关注，俩个操作不同。
Dear followers. I would like to explain as this system works in more detail. The system consists of 2 EA. One of them trades on M30 and opens short-term positions. Other EA trades on H1, trade duration is between a few hours and a few days. This EA does not close the position at a small profit, he is waiting for the big moves to get more pips. SL is triggered when allegedly the trend loses the potential on H1. Both EA mutually supplement each other and together they bring a steady income in Long-Term. Do not expect a high frequency trading. Trade is conducted completely automatically without manual intervention. Keep this in mind when you have a comment. Please, be patient with losses, because it is part of the business, and estimate trade not only on losses. Best Regards.

Using our method to identify which currency is undervalued and overvalued, thereafter we take that chance by long or short that currency. When the currency in inequilibrium, we will take the opportunity from that misspricing based on our method. Usually, we will wait until we believe that we enter in the right time.

Hello, I am a professional forex trader from more than 10 years. I use technical and fundamental analysis to make the signals. All trades are made manually and always with stop loss. Don´t expect huge gains but instead a risk managed account. My golden rules are: Never let a profit turn into a loss and A good trade is profitable right from the start. Take profit and Stop loss will always be used. To maximize your profits, i recommend 4 open positions MAX. Thank you and now we will make MONEY!!!!

My trading strategy is based on price action trading. I will use trends supported by EMA 8 and 21 days to enter and exit trades. I will use only seven pairs which include EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY and USD/CHF. These are the most commonly used pairs. Multiple entries of a single pair is limited to only three at any given time; otherwise it will be only one pair. Each entry will give SL of 50 pips and TP of only 50 or 100 pips depending on the factors of confluence. Normal risk to reward ratio will be 1: 1or 2. Using Daily or 4HR charts, the aim is to execute quality trades so that account equity is increased proportionately. It is advisable that should you decide to follow me, please also have your own methods of money management. One thing you also have to keep in mind is that no trading strategy is one hundred percent accurate. Sometimes a trade may go against you incurring a loss. If your gains are more than the losses you will make money. If you follow me patiently you are bound to make money consistently. Good Luck!

hola amigos, como veis durante los primeros meses de la estrategia van yendo las aguas a su cauce, la estrategia esta funcionando desde hace mas de 10 años pero aqui esta comenzando a verse sus frutos, la cantidad necesaria para esta estrategia (irixo) tiene que ser de un minimo de 2000 euros y seguirla completamente con la cantidad igual de lotes, nosotros ponemos 0.02 y la cantidad varia segun el riesgo. tratamos de seguir el carriy trade, estamos en el EUR/USD desde el principio donde comenzamos con una estrategia alcista pero las condiciones del mercado nos indican que EEUU comenzara a incrementar los tipos de interes con lo cual se ira a lalza el USD, el retorno de interes es es positivo en estos momentos para las comras sobre el EUR pero la tendencia de los tipos entre este par seguramente ira haciendo que se igualen mantendremos a medio largo las posiciones sobre el EUR e iremos cubriendonos con posiciones bajistas en momentos tecnicos favorables, con lo cual en algunos pmomentos podrian estar abiertas dos posiciones a la vez de compra y venta pero las posiciones de venta serian de corto plazo incluso de dias. El objetivo es conseguir mas del 100% aunual sobre el capital inicial de 2000 euros asi siempre todos los años. un saludo a todos y muchas gracias por su confianza.

My system has been in a drawdown period during the last months, but market conditions are changing and becoming more favorable for the system. I expect a slow but constant recovery in the following weeks.
Technical analysis mostly but always on the lookout for news events as well. I use multiple charts to generate signals, entry and exit. Not so much trades in the month since i try to reduce risk. My goal is to always have a positive pips balance every month and to have very low drawdowns.
After many years of trading practices and studies,I have accumulated FOREX trading experience and Rich skills.Therefore,I made a good trading results and I have my own unique and stable profit model. The strategy is swing trade type. One strategy buys and sells it throughout the year. Another strategy settles a position on every Friday.

the use of fundamental and technical analysis . following up on interest fluctuations , central banks meetings and macro updates . the use of technical analysis by g long term trends. the use of support and levels on the short and log term to be able to execute as many l trades as possible and avoid large draw downs
Blueprint trades on the basis of technical analysis, maximum open trades allowed are three with approximate loss of 50 pips around, mostly lot less.. and there could be one long term trade with maximum risk of 100 pips but not regularly, mostly we will trade short term and with strict stop loss. I am able to run in profit even with 50/50 win n loss ratio. For me key to the success is money management.

Good morning everyone.....Hi PEP......No 1 ?.....Please don't wish that curse on me lol....Having enough people that understand my way of trading is all i need :-).....In answer to your question, My stop will vary and my stops will move ( depending on my fundamental and technical view of the open trade)........For example...The GBPJPY trade i just closed was a short term scalp looking for 10+ pips......I placed my stop at 38 pips which was the next resistance plotted on my charts.....As this was intended to be a short term scalp, i would NOT have moved the stop......We went to -5 and banked 13.6 ...............With the 2 AUD trades i will take a different approach to stops as i have a strong fundamental opinion...I could be wrong of course...but that is why i apply stops.........The data from China has been horrible and AUD is dependent on trading to China...The AUD is not trading on fundamentals at this time....AUD is higher due to general USD weakness and the hope China with add stimulus ...(so bad is good)......It wont last in my view and so i will adjust my stops on AUD trades to get us through ........I will not go over 200 s/l on any individual position (see my account data )and 400 pips on the total open positions............Have a great day and best wishes.........................Mike...

'Back seat traders' are as 'helpful' as 'back seat drivers'!! There seems to be some misguided understanding from certain followers with their comments over trailing stops, moving stops to breakeven and when to take profits etc. For those of you who are eager to comment without first paying close observations to trades - All trades are entered such that when certain price levels are reached (as determined by the system rules based on many live trades and back testing ) the relevant trades have their stop losses moved up appropriately - this includes moving the stop loss up to a reduced tighter stop loss level, also to just over break even and also further up to lock in profit between entry and the desired take profit level! This has always been the case!! This system has its own system levels NOT other trading systems levels or certain followers own 'ideas' how stop losses should be moved up or profits made etc. What is right amount of pips for the stop loss to be moved up for one system DOES NOT mean it is right for another system - 'seasoned traders' know that to be true!! For this system, moving a stop loss level up too quickly and too tight will just result in many lost winning trades that WILL outweigh any potential 'gain' from having over tight stops! I will stick to what works best long term for this system and ignore misguided comments from inexperienced followers who cannot trust the Signal providers rules and system! That begs the question - why on earth are you live following any Signal provider if you first do not fully understand and have confidence in their system? Please I encourage you to just sit on the side and just demo follow or find another Signal Provider where the system suits better your trading personality and style! To help you further decide about this system and whether or not it may be of interest to you - please check out advanced stats on myfxbook (Pinnacle Pips). Finally, respect and regards to all followers!

Only the market rise, fall, three kinds of trend shocks, who dare not 100% sure which direction, because the transaction is the probability, but if the technical patterns familiar to me to appear on the chart, no matter what a group of currencies, I definitely want to do the transaction, whether it is to cross or down cross, I'm sure to trade, I in advance for each venture prepared 20% losses, once it touches the floor, I identify paid off. If the market can not bring me out, should I make money. Tell you, I have been adhering to this principle to do the transaction, the transaction is 80% money, lose money when he was only 20%. In front of the method and the principle of trading, I is a robot, observing the graph, the execution of the transaction.Thanks!

I use a unique formula to determine when the market is oversold or overbold. All trades are opened by direction of short and middle term swing this strategy very stable and secure. The position exit is very effective and close 80 per cent of positions at optimum profit, while a part of them close at minimum loss. This way stop Loss intervention is mostly prevented. All my trading is free of any emotions, free of any subjective factors based on proven trading rules. Only classical swing trade strategies without any martingales or other risky and deluding techniques.

The move in CAD yesterday was really something my friend..I wanted to wait until after the press con to see what Mr P had to say, and by that time the move was in freefall . See if USDCAD can regain 1.2450 /1.25 in the days ahead ( i have my doubts )..and then we have a trade !
The statistics of this account is maximum 3 open position and targeting pip will be more than 15 pips as daily average. At the same time 100% winning will not be maintained in critical situations. In case if the trade holds in negative at the day end, next day's trend will be considered. if the next day's trend is also the same, the open positions will be held else closed. So following this account strategy,
The goal is to provide stable, consistent profits and a high average pips per trade with as little risk as possible. For maximum profit, please follow all my signals. Please set your lot to the safest level to avoid Margin Call. This strategy is flexible time frame depend on how long the trend is continue going on. Lets creates some profits.
As you can tell from the title, this account will never open more than 3 trades at the same time. This strategy is based on a combination of Moving Average and Support Resistance line. I'm still in business. This strategy is flexible time frame depend on how long the trend is continue going on. Lets creates some profits.
All trades will have a tight stop loss and the trades will be in the direction of the medium and long term trend.I trade all currencies depending on what pair that has the highest probability of win according to my analysis at that moment. This is probably the simplest system you'll ever come across. Opening only one trade at a time, my goal is to make as many pips as possible while keeping drawdown at a minimum.
Tous les métiers auront un stop loss serré et les métiers seront dans le sens de moyen et long terme trend.I commerce toutes les devises en fonction de ce couple qui a la plus forte probabilité de victoire selon mon analyse à ce moment-là . C'est probablement le système le plus simple vous jamais rencontré . Ouverture seul métier à la fois, mon objectif est de faire autant de pépins que possible tout en gardant tirage au minimum .

Dear Investers, I found that I can not follow 2 different strategies at the same time, it make me mess. So I killed this account to focus on my other account name Planet 999. Please Follow me at that account. Thank you!
NeoFX is a system based on technical indicators. I like to use my own Expert Advisor. I have 6 years of experience with Forex. When trading foreign exchange, emotions play a giant role. Take the example of a trader executing a trade in the hopes to make a profit off it but in fact ends up losing the trade. The consequent trades placed are majorly controlled by the emotional decisions made, which are built on the result of the earlier trade. The advantage of trading with a foreign exchange Professional Advisor removes these emotions so that trading can be executed on a purely logical basis. The NeoFX expert advisor uses dynamic TP and fixed SL targets. Please adjust your lot size according to your account balance. Pair: EUR/USD – Max Open Orders: 1 – StopLoss: 100 pips. Be Patient. Stay Disciplined.Patience, it's a virtue...Especially in trading. The best thing you can do to stay patient and disciplined is to look at your career as a trader as a marathon and NOT a sprint.Thank you!

A total of 10 trades will be opened with a total account stop loss of 500 pips. All manual trades .. I use very short term charts to time entry and exit of trades. No EA's will be used on this account and open trades will be monitored at all times.. Thank you,

We use Relative Value Strategy in our trading. We seek to exploit differences in the price or rate of the same or similar currencies. We will take long positions on currencies considered undervalued, while taking short positions on currencies considered overvalued. Trade Major Currencies, and for the maximum open position would be 10 in the same time. Because we short and long currencies in the same time, you have to follow all of our trading signal in order to generate the same result with us. Thanks

After many many trials and error i re-adjusted my trading strategy and thus here i am with a new style, it follows trend so i called it trend-continuation. My aim is to grab 10pips plus here and there and to be as profitable as possible, of course we would not have a holy grail system so i would try to minimize the drawn down to as little as possible. Using MACD and Moving averages i'm able to continue to follow the continuation of a trend, i would use 5mins to enter and exit, Happy pips to all.

Dear friends: welcome to join. The maximum position of this method was 20. Advises followers according to their own funds to set up an account risk ability. Can be set to stop, documentary transaction amount not to exceed the maximum position of the strategy proposed 3-8 60% [hand]. Thank you for your support and trust.

The strategy is very simple...........I will open up to 8 trades in the same pair looking for a quick win.............Take all 8 trades or take less. It is really up to you...It depends how quickly you need your new Ferrari ( My little joke).............If the market goes against us I will stop us out on..., or much before we reach minus 500...........FOR EXAMPLE the profit today from 8 trades was 208 pips....The profit for yesterday ( April 9) using the 8 trades was a massive 542 pips. and the profit for the day before (8 April) was an even more massive 835 pips******The risk is very well defined and the rewards should outweigh the risks...This is a trading account for people who understand Forex and risk reward ratios^^^^^Best Wishes...........Mike.

The maximum stop loss for every trade is 100 pips and it is never modified after the trade is open. We recommend you to allow 2 or 3 open trades at the same time with lower leverage rather than allowing a single high leverage trade. We do so because our system usually performs much better when signals are so strong that allow more than one trade at the same time
My new investment strategy; Under fundamental analysis, judgment-based,reference technical indicators to operate. Each time positions 1-3,stop loss and win will make decisions based on the actual market situation. I will pay particular attention to risk control. Also, under uncertain circumstances i will reduce operations, or even stop the operation. When the situation is more clear, I will be relatively more radical. I hope that through our joint efforts to achieve a win-win.

Let's hope this is just a pull-back in the down-trend. Either way please don't lecture us as that's not what you are paid for. The only thing that matter is making money, not being right. You can only make money if you manage and minimize draw-down, which right now you are not doing!

The trading strategy is a semi-automatic approach, which means that a computer generates trade signals based on human designed parameters selected by our expert traders. These settings are the foundation of our signals’ quality and take into account several decades of experience collected by our traders: Experience that cannot be replaced by a computer. The automatic generation, on the other hand, keeps our traders’ heads free for the improvement of the strategy and the parameters while minimizing the effect of human error. In the last stage of signal generation, these automatically generated signals are then again hand-filtered by our traders. Computer generated signals do not take into account external factors like upcoming news events or political situations that can have an effect on a trade, so we can comfortably filter out signals that imherit too much risk from one of these factors.

Forex trading is simple, in a sense, but it is not necessarily easy. My strategy to profit from Forex trading is to make use of the technical tools such as charts and indicators but at the same time, be aware of the fundamental factors that are the real driving force behind any trends. I am using my trend trading system and risk management to my every day trading. Hopefully I could help you to make some extra money.

Dear friends, the foreign exchange trade well, we need to do two things, one is in control of your position, the two is carefully analyzed and summarized. I will strive to do a good job in these two points. Hope all subscriptions can position to follow my signal.)----keepup and try
All trades will have a tight stop loss and the trades will be in the direction of the medium and long term trend.I trade all currencies depending on what pair that has the highest probability of win according to my analysis at that moment. This is probably the simplest system you'll ever come across. Opening only one trade at a time, my goal is to make as many pips as possible while keeping drawdown at a minimum.
Proven profitable for 5 years run. Major in euro and pound, other major currencies may also be traded in some conditions. 1k is required to trade for 0.1 lot, SL between 100 and 200 depending on market volatility. May open up to 5 maximum trades. Good luck and let's earn some passive income together.
After many years of trading practices and studies,I have accumulated FOREX trading experience and Rich skills.Therefore,I made a good trading results and I have my own unique and stable profit model.I use graph time fame 15 minute. I find the graph consolidation and draw the rectangle.Uses three technical indicators(RSI,Stochastic, 2MA);
As you can tell from the title, this account will never open more than 3 trades at the same time. This strategy is based on a combination of Moving Average and Support Resistance line. I'm still in business. This strategy is flexible time frame depend on how long the trend is continue going on. Lets creates some profits.
I take profit around 115-130 pips and stop loss 75-80 pips. new thinking new account but same old experience . i have a very refined approach when trading that is a> i dont have a ego so i can take losses and b> i dont have greed so when i think i have enough i take the ball and go home .

Dear followers, I would like to share with you some practical advice:Because in trading there are ups and downs number one priority is to protect our capital.You should adjust your account settings so that an 100 pip movement doesn't exceed 1-2% of your total capital.For example a $5000 account should be adjusted so that 100 pips equate with $50-$100 ($0,5-$1 per pip).According to your risk appetite you could fine-tune this number upwards or downwards.

Some win , some lose , you cannot win all , also we make mistakes , it is two side trading but WE ARE WINNERS IN THE LONG RUN... Please read my rules and my reminders. Then you can choose to follow or not. We start with this assumption...no one knows anything and never forget ... we are trading only probabilities and we dont make predictions... THREE REMINDERS to my followers... 1) When i choose to open 30 positions it is possible a drawdown 3000 pips. I mean 30 x 100 = 3000 because my STOP LOSS IS NEVER * MORE THAN * 100 PIPS PER TRADE. So everyone who want to follow my trades... must see the comfortable size for yours lots. First we have to protect our accounts and then we look to make profits in this dangerous world of forex market. 2) Do not close my open positions by your self ... this is my job. 3) when i choose to open 30 positions it is possible sometimes my trades are for different pairs so again see your comfortable lots size. From my side i try to do my best to have 70% to 80% winning trades with good average pips per trade. Thank you and dont forget my FIRST (1) reminder.

Analysis on top of day trade pivots on major instruments. This EA watches the signals looking for repeated crossingof significative points for a given symbol. After it crosses down on a relative short time may indicate we are facinga immediate bearish trend. Crossing otherwise up, may indicate a day trade in favour of a bullish market at the next 24 hours. Based on that conclusions, decisions are taken.


This is a hedging strategy based on 4hrs and 1 day charts technical analysis. I open many trades so pls. allow maximum open position. Also allow multiple positions for same currency. I aim to close full sequence in profit. Each sequence is for one currency pair. I do not open multi currency sequencies. Make sure your Margin Call -o- Meter is below 80%. Thank you for your interest. I wish you all the best. :)
Ma strategie se compose de positions longues et courtes. Il ya un degré de couverture intégré. L'idée de base est que les trades perdants peuvent être compensées par les plus rentables, à un certain moment l'ensemble du système des métiers devient positif et ferme toute les position de la même paire. Le backtest à 99% donne une chute de 25% max sur les deux dernière année pour 1000 $.
tip of the day: never change a winning system!
An expert advisor is working 24h/5day, and is looking for overbought and oversold situations at six pairs. The trading frequence is not so high. The EA works with different indicators and timeframes to recognice the right entry signal. The exit signal depends on reaching the take profit or the timestopp. The EA can open, depending of the trading setup, up to 8 positions with the same lot size. The Demo account is running with an equity of 1K. In a backtest during the last 5 years the drawdown was low, but this is not a guaranty for the future. Don´t oversize your account! Welcome to all Investors!

Работа по индикаторам: Awesome Oscillator; Alligator. Стратегия проверена временем, агрессивна, но эффективна. Используются базовые теоретические знания волновых теорий, концепции числовой последовательности Фибоначчи и индикаторы Билла Вильямса. Тактика заключается в следующем. При появлении сигнала индикатора делается первая ставка, чаще всего малоэффективная, так как первичные сигналы чаще всего ложные. Далее сигналы проверяются и открываются новые ставки. Количество ставок определено рыночной ситуацией и правилами работы трейдера (до 30 ставок). После разворота ценового движения ставки закрываются по достижении прибыли, достаточной для покрытия проскальзывания и других комиссий. Я не наращиваю прибыль долго, но в просадках могу находиться долго, пока цена не выйдет в зеленую зону…

В основе стратегии лежит принцип волнового движения. Рынок воспринимается как Бурлящий Океан, а трейдер как серфер, рискующий, но катящийся на волне. Чтобы катится на волне дольше, нужно забраться на самую вершину, поэтому ставки открываются заблаговременно (против тренда) в ожидании разворота цены. Вход в рынок осуществляется на временных графиках М1 - М5 по сигналам индикаторов: RSI; Stochastic Oscillator; MACD; Awesome Oscillator; Moving Average. Индикаторы имеют индивидуальные настройки, которые изменяются при изменении поведения рынка. Позиции открываются последовательно до момента разворота тренда с учетом волновой теории. Выход из рынка происходит после первого сильного движения цены в сторону роста прибыли. Для удачной работы последователь должен копировать все сигналы и быть с трейдером постоянно. Изучайте статистику счета. Правильно соразмеряйте ваш депозит с количеством выделяемого суммарного объема лотов всех рабочих ставок. Мой начальный депозит 1000$. Объем лота – 0.01. Максимальное количество открытых ставок – 30. Суммарный доход, время и другие параметры вы можете увидеть в статистике счета. 50-70% прибыли в месяц вам гарантированы, если вы будите настраивать правильно свои счета, не стараясь обогатиться, работая одной ставкой с большим объемом – это будет ошибкой. Удачи в торговле!!!

Technical and Fundamental to conquer the forex market. I trade a lot of times economic news releases. That makes it easier to ride on news and gain easy pips. The key to success is analyzing forecasting case studies. Open Positions: about half a day, Max Positions:7 (rarely max to 7), Max DD: 800pips.

Уважаемые последователи! Я работаю объёмом. Кто-то делает одну сделку с объёмом один лот и ждет результат. Я же, такой объём (один лот) делю на сто сделок. И ввожу эти сделки в работу по разному… То есть, в работе может находится максимум сто сделок с объёмом 0,01 лота, что в сумме составит один лот. Второе, я исключаю маленький размер SL – это убивает депозит!!! При нормальной работе SL рассчитывается по дневным свечам, а это более 250 Pips. Вы должны правильно рассчитывать соотношение своего депозита к рабочему объёму суммы сделок и их общей максимальной просадки. Удачи в торговле!

Суммарный доход, время и другие параметры вы можете увидеть в статистике счета. 50-70% прибыли в месяц вам гарантированы, если вы будите настраивать правильно свои счета, не стараясь обогатиться, работая одной ставкой с большим объемом – это будет ошибкой. Удачи в торговле!!!

This account is running 2 strategies: The first strategy on all pair is using overbought or oversold context. Each position have a SL and a TP. There are no more than 3 positions in same time.

Фундаментальные развороты рынка не бывают без последствий. Стоит набраться терпения и реально оценивать ситуацию. Рынок коварен и иногда, его сложно понять, даже очень опытным трейдерам.
В основе стратегии лежит принцип волнового движения. Рынок воспринимается как Бурлящий Океан, а трейдер как серфер, рискующий, но катящийся на волне. Чтобы катится на волне дольше, нужно забраться на самую вершину, поэтому ставки открываются заблаговременно (против тренда) в ожидании разворота цены. Вход в рынок осуществляется на временных графиках М1 - М5 по сигналам индикаторов: RSI; Stochastic Oscillator; MACD; Awesome Oscillator; Moving Average. Индикаторы имеют индивидуальные настройки, которые изменяются при изменении поведения рынка. Позиции открываются последовательно до момента разворота тренда с учетом волновой теории. Выход из рынка происходит после первого сильного движения цены в сторону роста прибыли. Для удачной работы последователь должен копировать все сигналы и быть с трейдером постоянно. Изучайте статистику счета. Правильно соразмеряйте ваш депозит с количеством выделяемого суммарного объема лотов всех рабочих ставок. Мой начальный депозит 1000$. Объем лота – 0.01. Максимальное количество открытых ставок – 30. Суммарный доход, время и другие параметры вы можете увидеть в статистике счета. 50-70% прибыли в месяц вам гарантированы, если вы будите настраивать правильно свои счета, не стараясь обогатиться, работая одной ставкой с большим объемом – это будет ошибкой.

Уважаемые последователи! Я работаю объёмом. Кто-то делает одну сделку с объёмом один лот и ждет результат. Я же, такой объём (один лот) делю на сто сделок. И ввожу эти сделки в работу по разному… То есть, в работе может находится максимум сто сделок с объёмом 0,01 лота, что в сумме составит один лот. Второе, я исключаю маленький размер SL – это убивает депозит!!! При нормальной работе SL рассчитывается по дневным свечам, а это более 250 Pips. Вы должны правильно рассчитывать соотношение своего депозита к рабочему объёму суммы сделок и их общей максимальной просадки. Удачи в торговле!

Small Bites. I have a style that takes small bites of the Forex markets movements to achieve a monthly gain that is safe from heavy loss. I first analyze for the big trend and only trade with it. A greed free process that goes for the mid-section of every move( not trying to get in early or stay in to the end) gives you a shot at steady growth. Using sound cash management to stay far from margin issues and looking for the sure thing is the style of a timid trader however it is also the style of a trader whyou from a margin call and still allow for a steady growth. This also protects you when a draw-down happens and they will sometimes. I will not be responsible for people that try to over-trade and have loss.

Principles of my trade strategy. Search of a turn and purpose definition. Indicators are for this purpose used. After definition of a turning candle (it is designated by an arrow and is determined by candle indicator crossing) the turning zone or the price channel (it is limited in drawing to dashed lines) on it the purpose of alleged movement (levels fibo) in two levels (an entrance to the market one with partial closing of a position or two warrants take profits - the first on the first purpose (area between 141-161% of a turn zone) the second TP on the second purpose (261% percent from a turn zone) is defined. When determining the purposes for take profit it is used as H1 and H4. Exposure of StopLoss a maximum or a minimum of the previous movement to the opposite side.

If you fallow strictly all my signals like recommended, you will make money :) Use fix lotsitze, for every 100 USD, 0.01 Standardlots. My signals agree with the broker rules too.

Recommend followers, to get the maximum profit do not limit number of open trades. If you set less trades, it would decrease the profitability.
Hello everyone. My system is careful selective trading of currency pairs based on economic calendar releases. I prefer to trade around these economic news reports and not before or after because these are the entities that drive the direction of forex trading. When economic news is released, I will wait a few minutes to allow the trading system to align in favor of the winning currency and place my trade accordingly. My system will attempt to generate profits ranging anywhere from 10-50 pips but may be more. I always try to get the maximum profit possible but due to constant market uncertainty I will always set my limit to about 30 pips max if I am away from the computer. Please adjust your settings to about 0.3 std lots and slowly increase this till you are confident in my strategy. Thank you

NFP WEEK, we expect a large move in the USDJPY.
I am a full trader in forex market . The target is win 200 pips by week . Mainly I use pivot points and trend lines . The maximum loose in a trade is 200 pips , in order to avoid the risk of great drawdown . It is possible some days I am out , that´s depend what about the economic calendar . Trades that are not close during the day , will be closed before 10 PM GMT , and re open after 10 PM GMT , to avoid the cost of roll over , except on Friday . The maximum drawdown will never exceed 1400 pips , so it is my strategie to close some trades and re open them , if I see that the risk to exceed the drawdown of 1400 pips is high .

This strategy is a mainly a trend following one. There will not be many trades and I will let the profits run. The win loss ratio should be like 5 or 10 to 1 so I will have more losses than wins. There will be very bad streaks also, so beware.
The strategy provides for profit in the long term. The strategy allows a large number of open positions in the long term, so please use a minimum lot size and allow all trades. In general, one side open positions amount not more than 15. Per year on average earned 15000 pips profit. Trading currency pair is GBP/AUD.I will be happy to serve you.
Dear followers, please take into consideration that maximal historical drawdown at real account forward test for this strategy is about 300-400 pips. And it happens about two times a year. So following me with 1 standart lot may bring you a huge profit but also may theoretically lead to 3000 - 4000 USD drawdown.
My strategy is based on price action, volume based activity, and trend following. I also look at other traders here and get trading ideas but aim to avoid the mistakes so many of them do by not managing risks properly or at all. Max 1 mini lot per $1000, max trading positions is 5 currently. Will update here is this changes as per market activity.
Started Training by changing Trading Behaviour, and try to make profit from every trade and protect your investment.
I trade a portfolio of 12 currency pairs. I seek to maximize my expected return and minimize any risk building my trading portfolio. I place only pending orders every day between 6 am and 7 am GMT with a fix SL and a TP. My risk to reward ratio is 1:2, means I risk for each trade 1% of my account to gain 2%. Because of changing market conditions it could happen I close the position before hit my target.

My plan for this month is: 1)trading with support and demand zone and use resistance and support line 2) max open trade is 5 in all pair 3) max open trade in one pair is 1 open position 4) max stop lost will be 40 pips per trade.
Hello Followers. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. I will be happy to answer them! ;)

Trading system based on Price Action and Fundamental analysis. I operate with major pairs and few crosses. I use 4H, 1D and 1W time frame. The most important thing for me is money management, good risk/reward ratio. I trade short and long term using stop loss and profit targets on all positions.
Version 5.1 of MegaForexEA to experienced problems which caused a significant loss of capital on May 2015. I reacted, I optimized MegaForexEA to minimize the losses, there will be a maximum of 3 positions permitted for each BUY, the same rules for SELL. I have great hope that this version 6.3 of MegaForexEA will be much more stable. the previous version nevertheless proved that the strategies were good, the fault was at the security level, problem corrected in this version 6.3. >>>>> Version 6.3 is active from 05.25.2015 <<<<<

I'm interested in investing for nearly 3 years. Through trial and error I created my system based on: 1. Fibonacci ratio 2. Zones demand / supply 3. The lines of support and resistance 4. Equal price levels, such as 1.27000 Combining these criteria choose the best point of entry into the market. My stop loss is narrow between 30-60 pips depending on the currency pair and market dynamics. I am a supporter of the Stop Loss adjustment with the development of a position to protect their profits. Of course not promise that there won't be positions lossy, this can not promise any trader. Good luck

My account runs a manual method based on trend following on the EURUSD, the major idea here is to make the most profits with the least amount of loss and minimum drawdown, the plan is to catch the pair when it is trending and make on average 30 pips each time we enter a trade, drawdown is controlled by entering another position that will start gaining if previous one is in loss

The new system has been working very good...
In years that I’ve been trading forex and learning to trade, there’s been a lot of lessons – each with varying degrees of usefulness. One of the things that has really helped which I heard quite a few times before I implemented it, is to focus on trading just one pair at a time. As newer traders we’re wanting to trade our way to financial freedom
Counter trend strategy based on the GBPUSD. Time Frame: 15MIN Max Open Trades: 5 Indicators Used: RSI, MA, STOCH Closing of Trades: 3% account profit / 11% account loss / RSI and STOCH indicating change of direction. The account loss is a safety net. RSI and STOCH close levels for the most part are the first to hit in either case. Trades can be in profit or loss when the signals hits for closing of trades.
This strategy is based on static and dinamic support and resistance plotted on 4 hour charts on the major currency pairs. There will be a maximum of 4 open operations exploiting the correlations between currency pairs you will maintain the maximum drawdown low, then you should not limit the number of operations to be performed.
The strategy is a system trade. Long years, we study about FX trade. We make much of keeping a risk hedge and work hard to control draw Down as much as possible.so do not expect 100% of profit but expect 90% of profits in your cash flow as long am trading for you,,,,do your maths please. don't follow me please if you are not satisfied with me and the strategy am using...... all the best to you all as you make the dollas.

This is an automated trade strategy that comprises of two EAs, one for hedging and another for martingale strategy. In a nutshell: Martingale is a cost-averaging strategy. It does this by “doubling exposure” on losing trades. This results in lowering of your average entry price. The idea is that you just go on doubling your trade size until eventually fate throws you up one single winning trade. At that point, due to the doubling effect, you can exit with a profit. I use hedging to protect open positions against adverse moves in foreign exchange rates, and placing a foreign exchange hedge can help to manage foreign exchange rate risk.

my strategy based on moving average crosses price action, digital analyses, supports and resistances,, i strongly recommend to use small lots (10%-15% of the margin) ,,i will trade on ALL currencies pairs,, i will NOT trade with gold or silver i will try hard to not be in big drowdown maximum open position up to 15 depends on chances in market............lets earn some money!!
I use a number of different models (Elliott, Gann etc.) to project specific high resonance zones in a currency pair's trajectory, which select for orbit terminal points, i.e. tops and bottoms. Plausible strategic regimes are back tested, and filtered specifically to reduce data snooped biases. Next, I employ strict risk and capital allocation protocols to limit and filter for the highest value entry strategies.

This trade singal set DD -60 pips when open a positon,because I must control risk.I have traded 7 years in forex market,so I know how to trade every position.This singal will get 200-400 pips every month.I will do my best work in this,thank you all dear followers!
The maximum stop loss for every trade is 60 pips and it is never modified after the trade is open. We recommend you to allow 1or 2open trades at the same time with lower leverage rather than allowing a single high leverage trade. We do so because our system usually performs much better when signals are so strong that allow more than one trade at the same time

Hello dear followers, we would like to inform you that we will place another trade signal for GBPUSD and USDCHF.We sincerely apologize for the wrong entry or rather early entry for the initial USDCHF Buy signal.Thanks for your understanding.Maxington.
First, key support & resistance levels ... second, candle reversal patterns with price action move. The combination of those two factors will generate a reliable signal for entry & exit in high winning probability trade. A candlestick pattern has more power and can be more reliable on a bigger time frame resembling very much with price patterns. On higher time frames they will appear less than on lower time frames, meaning that on lower time frames they could also give lots of false signals. Stop loss always and risk management.

'After' that unusual and unexpected price move, all kinds of 'rational' reasons come out to support that move. In trading, you don't have to have the best hand to win. The 'market' inclines to clean out some of the smart long n induce more short before making that killing up move. The 'market' always wins. So carefully money management with the best risk reward for my positions. Thank you.

I use a unique formula to determine when the market is oversold or overbold. All trades are opened by direction of short and middle term swing this strategy very stable and secure. The position exit is very effective and close 80 per cent of positions at optimum profit, while a part of them close at minimum loss. This way stop Loss intervention is mostly prevented. All my trading is free of any emotions, free of any subjective factors based on proven trading rules. Only classical swing trade strategies without any martingales or other risky and deluding techniques.

Hola amigos, voy a abrir un máximo de 4 posiciones por par, yo solo comercio gbp-usd y eur-usd. así que podria abrir 8 posiciones en total. Es muy raro que abra 8 posiciones porque generalmente yo opero un par y me concentro ahi hasta que cierro la operación, solo si existe una gran oportunidad en la otra moneda comercio 2 al mismo tiempo. SIEMPRE estoy detrás de mi laptop cuando tengo una operación abierta, mis posiciones nunca duran mas de 24 hrs abiertas Mi stop loss nunca es mayor a 150 pips, pero generalmente no lo fijo inmediatamente para proteger de un slippage, sin embargo. Mi drawdown por par es de 450 (por par) quiero decir, si solo comercias un par conmigo, ya sea eur-usd o gbp-usd el DD debe ser 450, si comercias ambos serán DD 900. Yo voy a generar entre 250 y 600 pips por semana. Lo mas importante en forex: ***Conservar Capital ***Drawdown Menor de 1000 pips ***Mas de 100 pips por semana o 500 por mes ***Maximo 10 operaciones abiertas ***Operacion Exitosa Mayor que 75% ***Continuidad Gracias...

Try to stick with the trend and not let what you think is logical stop you from believing in the trend. This is when tuning out the noise helps. Weekly and 1H charts for entries and exits. Position size and risk management is the key to all this. The minute you feel euphoric take some chips off the table.
The basis of this trading is that there are trade-able correlations between currency pairs. These correlations are not 100% consistent but when certain pairs move in one direction, associated pairs often generally follow. They are applying trend trading to multiple currencies. So basket traders are jugglers. They see multiple charts at one time and make decisions based on multiple inputs. They can trade a single currency or multiple currencies simultaneously. Their biggest challenge is understanding when the traditionally related pairs are most likely to move in unison. Just like trend traders, they often use lagging indicators to determine the trend of multiple currency pairs. And sometimes when they realize that all associated pairs are moving in one direction it is to late to get it as the pairs have moved their own ways again.

Currencies have their own “characters” or behavior. Different indicator set-ups, different values may be used to achieve best results for each currency pair. For my trades look to find the most active hours for a chosen currency pair. Those hours of currency highest activity are easy to spot on the chart and should be used to get maximum profits during the trading session.
4 open trades maximum. We are not & do not pretend to be right all the time, but i got a system that works & keeps u in the right side 80% of the time. Experienced traders risking 2% will take the hit and move on to the next trade not affected by the loss. Stop loss and entry levels.
Trade one position only at the same time,this is a real trade singal.Set loss pips less than 50 pips then get about 20-100 pips every trade.Trade are focus on most currenices pairs only.he profit target is have 50 pips per week and have around 200-300 pips monthly.This singal will trade safety and can get some profits every month.You can use a demo account follow it,if you believe this singal can help you get profits then you can use your live account follow.Thank you!

Just using my 11 years experience to try and make more money than I lose. My style is discretionary. The R/R varies, but is never much worse than a 1:1 trade and sometimes much greater reward to risk. My charts are naked, as I only use my observations on what price is doing across all timeframes. I will hold no more than three trades open at any time. One trade for small moves, one for larger moves, and one for stronger conviction than normal. I will never add to a losing trade, period. I will always be in control of the trade and myself, that I can promise.

Dear followers: I am trying to provide good signals.
Cari seguaci il rublo dopo questa discesa potrebbe risalire e io ho intenzione di continuare a comprare rubli fino a 40.00 (soprattutto per il probabile aumento dei tassi da parte della BCR) chi non avesse intenzione di seguirmi lo invito cortesemente a limitare le compravendite o a disattivarmi fino a nuova comunicazione di cambio strategia. Grazie a tutti coloro che hanno creduto in me e vorranno ancora seguirmi nel mio trade. Buona giornata

this will be a swing and trend trading strategy with tight stops and looking for big profits. I will be looking for big breakouts in the major pairs. when the markets get very volatile and move very fast and in a big way this should be a good strategy. If trading microlots (0.01), the account should not be less than 250$. Preferably 300 Good trading
This trading system is automatic, developed on stochastics analysis of several timeframes. All signals are carried out at the breaking through level of 20 or for the purpose of entering level of 80. For stochastics will be used stop from the entry level of the considered TF. When entering into a long term position SL can raise to 60 pips. Target profit is 30 pips.
This strategy follows the long term trend. The most reliable and consistent trend there is. Trades are entered from daily chart. I will be making trades with many pairs, you may choose to select handful of them, but my recommendation for best results is to follow all of them. There is set default stop loss of 100 pips. Happy pipping!
After a period of exploration and practice, I have improved my own investment techniques and methods. I will adhere to the synthesized timing of transactions based on. Through market analysis, judgment, grasp the timing of the transaction, cautious and stable trading Major currencies; EUR—USD, AUD—USD, GBP—USD, etc. Mainly 1-5 positions each time. I will stick to my strategy and discipline and strive to create a better tomorrow. Thanks!

I base my trades on technical analysis but I also use some fundamental analysis. My main strategy is in determining the support and resistance lines in the currency pair and trade the breakouts from the news and wait for the price to reach the next support/resistance line. My research is based on the current affairs of the economy.
A widely used indicator in technical analysis that helps smooth out price action by filtering out the “noise” from random price fluctuations. A moving average with SMA... trend following indicators, or also known as lagging indicator. Candlestick price action trader with looking to outcomes and sentiment index. Risk Reward and money management.
In my sytem i use higher time frames... so give me more time to adjust to changing conditions and my trading efficiency (trading without mistakes) will be higher. Importantly, a higher timeframe is often the set-up for a lower timeframe. Once i determine the market type on the weekly charts, i can slide down to the daily or hourly charts to snipe for an entry , but first must to define market direction on the weekly charts.
The system is designed according to the method of establishing certain time intervals on the other. Based on the application of this method is able to control in a single worksheet system, multiple time slots, which are fed the signals relative to each other, which in turn helps to filter out price noise, and to determine more accurately the direction of the price after the pulse, and using the smaller is the time interval to entry into the market in the direction of the momentum.

الاستراتيجية تعتمد على دخول صفقات مدروسة ضمن تحليل فني وكلاسيكي مع مراعاة الإدارة السليمة لرأس المال ويكون الدخول بشكل يومي على عدة أزواج ووضع أهداف واستوبات لكل صفقة نقوم بها وترك الصفقة للهدف أو الستوب حسب وضع الصفقة وفي بعض الأحيان نقوم بوضع أوامر تعزيز للصفقات الخاسرة بنفس الستوب والهدف وبالتوفيق للجميع تحياتي .
This strategy is based on pivot points and ADX. It's simple but effective. Only ONE trade at same time. There is going to be take profit and stop loss, ALWAYS. Both are configured in 30+ pips. As you can see this is not a trade and pray game. Good trades.
This is a very simple strategy that can be used quickly. The moving averages that i will use in my trading should be tuned to offer better results and the candlestick pattern should meet the theoretical characteristics for higher probability of success. I never forget to use money management along with this relatively simple trading strategy. Stop Losses are required for protecting my account in case of losing trades. I do not underestimate the market, even though the probability might be in favor when i using this strategy, it might happen to catch a false signal and find myself in a losing trade. And i trade what i see and not what i think i see!

Max around 2 trades in the same time, some times positions will be opening for more than one day. The strategy works with relatively medium leverage

Don't forget to pray to allah, so we succes trade in the forex. Ok come on we playing to forex and good luck
This is a long-term strategy, so 3 - 6 month time frame should be a minimum. Withing that time some orders are closed on minus, but that is how the strategy works. It cuts the losses quickly, I don't leave open orders hoping, that in some future they'll profit, it's based on tested and verified signals.

Auto Steps strategy is the daily technical and fundamental analysis based on the position opening. EUR GBP USD JPY CHF AUD NZD CAD. The goal is usually given as 5 - 100 pips. Allow me lots 20 - 30 micro opening position. I do not like to lose! I expect the rate of 100% profitable trades! Just like any open positions, which will be delivered! I hope at the end of each month are calculated
The trade strategy is based on combination of fundamental and technical analysis, sometimes few positions take place according to market sentiment ,with short-term goals. Close look on macroeconomics,in order to define the primary trend, most important support and resistance levels (Daily,4H,1H charts), thereby choosing the optimal point to open a position. I choose positions,having correlation between them in mind,not to overexpose myself or to hedge responsibly. SL 15-200 pips,depending on a volatility and a target for chosen pair. Good Luck!

Dear followers. I work mainly on the strength of currencies by analyzing the trend of each currency and then opening positions among the strongest currency and the weakest of the moment. Before opening the position always check the trend of the change and the support and resistance, then I determine if it is possible to gain and then identify the take profit easiest to reach.
I am currently trading this strategy on 6 pairs. My strategy is based on trendline, support/resistance, and channel analysis. You can expect to see an average of 4 and 12 trades placed every week. Each order starts with a stop loss of -125 and then it locks in 25 pips once the price is 50 pips over entry price and then it locks in 125 pips once its 250 pips over entry price. The take profit is set at 999 above entry by default and that is rarely adjusted.

Dear Investors, We will strive to provide high quality market analysis, regular updates on the status of our trading account, and prompt responses to all inquiries made by our partners. However, we cannot emphasize enough the importance of patience and discipline. A significant component of any successful trading plan includes mental discipline. Our goal is to provide a smooth equity curve with limited drawdown, but patience is required to ride out the natural ebb and flow of currency fluctuations. Two weeks of break even results followed by several weeks of profit is perfectly normal. Please remember that our methodology is based on fundamental and technical analysis, current price action, and global equity flows. We do not use a static system that is wildly successful under current market conditions, but tends to crash and burn when market conditions change. We often make decisions based on real-time market analysis, our internal account equity goals, and prudent money management and risk assessment. All of this in combination with our fundamental and technical analysis gives us our trading edge. Trading is not a perfect science. Although we certainly use statistical analysis in our trading, we also treat trading like a business and make decisions based on sound business principles. If you are looking to gamble with wild fluctuations in account equity to hit the jackpot or avoid taking a loss, this SP is not for you. If you are looking for a static system that will crash and burn when market conditions change, this SP is not for you. If, on the other hand, you are interested in growing your account equity through reasonable and consistent growth month after month, year after year, we look forward to having you join our team! In the end, investment decisions should be based on results. Our goal is to gain your trust through consistently profitable trading and well-managed risk. All the best for a safe and profitable February!!!

I am a famous fx analyst in Turkey. I use my own methodology and indicators worked up over ten years of trading all the different markets including Currencies, Futures, Commodities and Stocks. This strategy trades the major currency pairs. I will day trade and swing trade. Stops are used on all positions. I will manually adjust the stops when I feel appropriate. This strategy may be classified as aggressive relative to forex. Be diversified and use only risk capital. I believe this may be an excellent vehicle for subscribers to participate and have exposure to Forex. I believe a 3 - 6 month time frame should be a minimum for any strategy. My goal is to try to make this a top rated strategy that maximizes profits, establish good gains for the amount of risk taken and be consistent as possible. The above is a goal not a guarantee. I would like to have my Subscribers accepting Signals for the Long Term. I very much appreciate your business! Thanks

Divergence Lookout for indicators that are signalling a change in trend before the price reverses. Size of the candle Large candles can signal an important event has happened that may create a change in the trend. Information about where orders and stops are sitting in the markets can be excellent set-ups. Also sentiment trading is a relatively new innovation in the Forex market. By knowing which way the “herd” is positioned, you can choose to either follow or fade the trend.

Price action candles are thought to already have the news factored in. In other words, whatever the news does, it is already showing us on my charts. Price may be getting close to a support level when a news release is announced. Price most times will still respect the support level regardless of what the news had to say, and from just watching and following raw price, i could see what price was likely to do.
Hi all, We have been going through a rough patch the past few months however, things seem to be resuming upwards and the stop losses are being hit less and less we are considering starting to change the lot sizes in accordance to the risk and reward of each trade but we will let you know once we decide to.
If I understand you correctly, these new trades that are opening are off the same amount so you should be able to follow them. You have to set what amount of lots that are best for you. So if you want to follow me with 0.1 lots (mini) that will work just fine, meanwhile I could trade with the 0.4 lots (mini) and it doesn't make a difference for you. Hope this clears it up for you.

Always pursue perfect transaction records, a defective will replace the new account, it is wrong. I should stick to it. I believe that I can do the top ten, also believe that I have the ability to follow my customers can make money.。。I will work hard to ensure that the past is the biggest loss rate 410pip.
Trading Mainly the GBP/USD and EUR/USD the FRY ON THE WALL will be as if it knew information that only the market makers are privy to. This system will make your investment accounts grow quickly. Just look at some of the trades investors have taken advantage of.we never open more than 3 trades at the same time which reduces the risk of losing hard earned capital.We always use TP on all open trades.SO LET OUR PERFOMANCE SPEAK FOR ITSELF.

so are only 30 pips stop loss, please keep follow me , do not worry about losing , I have a good winning strategy manually , if I lose a few operation not worry , I always recovered

Typically in my trades i will be using Fibonacci retracements or extensions looking for a confluence of a Fibonacci level with other signals such as support and resistance, pivots etc. The idea of overlapping Fibonacci is likely to be an exciting discovery. Because very often that is all i need in order to trade: two strong Fibonacci levels at an area of known support and resistance.

This strategy aims to ride on the trend of any currency pairs. It has been back tested, forward tested and stressed tested on currency pairs from USD, EUR, AUD, CAD, GBP, CHF and JPY. It carefully selects from the currency pairs and choose the best trade to enter. This would be the only signal that you can truly rely on

Enough years on Forex markets and i can say that ... knowing probabilities is important because to do predictions it is not easy with to many outcomes. So i trade when i find the best probabilities for a curreny pair. Carefully the level of margin for my trades because this is part of my risk management. I am a price action trader and try to follow my trades with yours comfortable size..
Personally I like to define market direction on the weekly or daily charts and then move to a lower timeframe for an entry with stop loss and limits. Once i determine the market type on the weekly charts, i can slide down to the daily or hourly charts to snipe for an entry.
My strategy is based on the observed behaviour of price where the Bollinger bands form a kind of limit for short-term price movement. In this respect Bollinger bands are well named, in that they almost exhibit the elasticity characteristics of rubber bands. Enough years on Forex markets and probabilities is important because to do predictions it is not easy with to many outcomes.

不断的失误让我感到慌乱，我发觉我有必要停一停，找一找问题出在哪儿。经过这一段的思考和总结，我觉得主要的问题有2方面：1是在下单时过于着急，特别是在亏损一单以后；2是在亏损一单以后，总是想在当天就把损失补回来。我将针对我的问题进行改正，提升交易水平。保持平和的心态，坚持长期稳定的盈利。我相信我们的将来会更好！

****The ACTIOMXX IS a system that uses The Dual Stochastic plus One custom Indicator uses two stochastics – one slow and one fast – in combination to pick areas where price is trending but overextended in a short term retracement, and about to snap back into a continuation of the trend. The basic rules are • wait for price to be trending strongly in short periods of times. • watch for the stochastics indicators to be at opposite extremes • and then for confirmation of an entry look for an appropriate candle pattern that signals a reversal after a short retracement to the 40 Ema. Best regards and happy trading ***

This is an aggressive strategy.Maybe there are 5 to 15 trades each day for steady pips.In the forex trade world ,constrol risk is the most important thing which gainning profit is base on.I bring you a new kind of safe mode trade. Stop loss is put for fast trade of swing strade. I always trade by candle stick and follows the trend of continuous days. I suggest you put 15 open trades in your accounts and set 100-pips stop loss for each trade.If I can keep winning by putting stop loss for each trade, so choose my strategy.

Powerful and effective trading strategy based on Elliott waves counting method. Trading FX crosses (mostly EUR, GBP against USD, JPY) on minutes charts. Stop loss usually from 50 to 100 pips. (Stoploss 100 pips aplies to GBP crosses). Profit taking usually from 25 pips up. Experienced trader with over eight years of trading experience. Using an original way of tracing Elliott waves inside trend channels to set accurate entries and exits. Great success rate of the method.

This trader does not have an approved description yet.
Whew, what a month! I honestly did not set out to make 3.5k pips for the month but the pips just kept rollin in :-) and of course we'll take it. Going forward guys please do not expect this type of performance to keep on repeating. I am aiming for 400-600 pips/month as target. The mega pip action, however, will always be there in reserve for when needed, e.g., for dd recovery. Enjoy the weekend everyone.
Good Week , + 178 pip ... I look forward to more profits next week , I wish you great weekend. Regards...
Stop loss 100 pips

After a month of reviewing strategy I will reopen positions. Stay tuned and enjoy morer pips! Less positions per week but more stable strategy version. Today March 31, 2015

I have been involved in trading for more than 7 years. Back to 1 years ago, i started to develop EA by merging my ideas of trading into automated trading EA to further avoid emotional trading. I hope by sharing this signal, it can help to bring profits to my subscribers. I have been able to achieve financial freedom through my trading since many years back, so i think now it is a right time to share to public to give another point of view how successful automated trading could be. Please note the following : a small start-up capital (under 500) leads to rapid Trading fail! During the Trading running, Margin shows level of less than 300%? The account owner decides if he saves his account. The only possibility is to his account, more money to pay a. Thank you for your interest.

I'm a trader at an emerging market hedge fund. I use Elliott Wave analysis, Demark indicators and various other proprietary technical indicators to identify inflection points in the markets that provide asymmetric, low risk/ high reward trades and use my knowledge of economic fundamentals, positioning and liquidity analysis to increase probability. My goal is to consistently make 100+ pips with small losses and consequently very small drawdowns. Due to FCA regulation, I'm not going to trade a live account as for every trade I do requires me to fill out a personal account dealing form and get signed approval from my boss which if I'm doing 2 to 3 trades a day isn't going to do me any favours.

트레이더 여러분! 저의 매매 전략을 간단히 설명드리자면 첫째, 저는 우선 펀더멘탈을 우선시 합니다. 그 날의 각국 경제의 흐름과 향후 방향을 예측하여 장기 트렌드를 읽고 단기적인 환율의 변화에 대한 예상으로 각 통화쌍에 대한 흐름을 읽습니다. 둘째, 보조지표를 참고로는 하지만 어디까지나 참고용으로만 보고 있는데 그 이유는 모든 보조지표는 거의 다가 후행성이기 때문입니다. 언제나 안전한 거래를 추구하기 위해 더 많은 노력을 기울이겠습니다. 좋은 하루 되시길..
Dollar is strengthening as we expected. Sticking to the rally, enjoying profitable positions.
new trades soon
This account use the concept of overbought and oversold .If you look at any FX chart, you will see trends but these trends, will have reactions to the upside and downside where prices are pushed to far up or down, away from the average price, but prices will always return to more realistic levels. The aim of the swing trader is – to sell into overbought levels and buy into oversold levels and liquidate the trade, when prices have returned to fair value. Markets will always spike to far up or down in the short term, because humans are emotional beings and they make trading decisions based upon greed and fear. This concept is easy enough to understand and will always occur, because human nature is constant and greed and fear are reflected in the chart as overbought and oversold levels

Estratega de bajo riesgo , no soy ambicioso, trato de sacar una ganancia de un 20% a un 30% anual, no me complico y solo tranzo con los pares de divisas mas comunes, las vario según las noticias fundamentales, es muy importantes que el valor de su lote sea el adecuado según la cantidad de su capital, el forex no es un juego, eso he aprendido, prefiero ser como la tortuga, lenta pero constante.
Orders are in for the week. If you cannot follow all 50 orders, please select one pair and follow all orders for that pair. Thanks, Ben
I use more then one technique to make sure make more pip.We will do our best to manage the risk .also monitor the market almost 24 hours a day. please be patient, I wish you the profits IF you have any question please write on comment we will respond to me as soon as possible
In our trading we use only mechanical trading systems of our own design tested on 10 years of history. EURUSD is the base currency. All systems from our protfolio have tight stops ( 50-80 pips ). Take profits targets are much greater. Most of the time we enter in a position with limit orders. We plan to post signals with moderate risk - from 1.75 to 2.2% per trade.
One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk. Variables such as the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses as well as maintaining adequate liquidity are material points which can adversely affect actual real trading results.
I use technical and fundamental. I also use my years of experience to time the market and It is the most important thing in my trading that makes me pips every day ...Use always money management because in reality not every trade is going to be a winner, but the key is to take every trade in order to see the result I saw the last 5 years .good luck!

My investment strategy : only GBP/NZD currency pair max 15 open positions stop loss max 310 pips. Stop being greedy !! You can’t expect to double your money in 24-hour, day by day. The first lesson you must learn is to think in long-term categories. Therefore learn to pick the profitable traders and use the right money management. If you respect this, your are ahead of the others and you could make profits with Social Trading.

Lion Pips. If a strategy is good then a robot will be able to trade it successfully. After all the goal of a trader is to have a winning strategy and strictly follow it. Who can do that better than a robot. There are 2 robots trading this account. One is very conservative and takes small gains here and there. And the other looks for trades that follow a trend and can give big returns. Only one can trade at a time in the account. So between the 2 we should see some good results. They will open 1 position or 2 separate positions per trigger. In order to MAXIMIZE your profit please follow my signals precisely with the following settings: 5-8 micro-lot for each $500 of your deposit.

We have completed our Enso EA tuning and re-activated the EA on all our MT4 acounts. The new version Enso 1.1 reduces average holding time by half to 6 hours, and is less aggressive in profit chasing in exchange for higher winning percentage, and take profit if double top/bottom resistance detected. With this update, we hope to fully hands-off trade execution to EA with a better peace of mind.
Dear follower ..my strategy is to take trade in two parts..So pls u can put half of ur set lot in first step n half in second..Om Tat Sat

The strategy is using medium and short timeframe trends and follows it accordingly. Pullbacks are used to enter trades. No hard SL is used, but every trade is monitored manually. If the trend has changed, position will be closed. There can be max 3 open trades per one currency pair, but not opened in the same time. Hedging is seldomly used to profit from corrections.

Thank you follow me .This is short term strategy , not aim at long term trend .When fall in large drawdown and the mid-term trend (on MT4 M30 chart )has changed ,I will close the exsiting order in negtive profit at a proper position .Recently ,the market is very fluctant and difficult to catch the best entry point,so I have reduced transaction .Do not follow with large lots,for 1000USD 0.1 lots only .Thanks.

Simple support/ resistance strategy with moving average filter. Entries are channeled with news and sometimes multiple time frame moving average. Strategy is scalp base along with adhoc swings.

Hello! The trading system is most effective for determining the correction or turn on any instruments traded on any timeframe used five indicators ZigZag with different inputs. The main task is to find a trading instruments already adopted figures (toe ZigZag indicator lines with different parameters at one point). Further forward the formation of two candles with peaks rising from the candles for deals Buy and dropping lows in candles for deals Sell. It is desirable, but not necessarily to the body color of the candles were the trend, ie Buy for deals body candles should be white; for transactions Sell - black). Work timeframes – M30, H1.

Hello! Indicators of my system are exponential moving averages (EMA) - EMA16, EMA48 and EMA96 (fan three EMA), which indicate the direction of the trend and give clear signals to open trades with the trend: the return of the price above / below EMA fans on the current upward / downward trend. The strategy is universal and suitable for all currency pairs, for use mainly in the day timeframes TF H1 and H4. The priority system is to work with the correction in the trend. The criterion for the trend is not the intersection of fast and slow moving averages, and the fan EMA.

Hello subscribers! Briefly about the strategy: - The strategy of short-medium term. - Trading in the day with small goals and feet. And when a good trend emerges, the open transaction with the objectives up to 25 points. - Use technical analysis. Use a semi-automatic trading method. - Use a clear sequence of opening and closing of the transactions (the levels of profit and losses once exhibited at the opening of the trade).
The trading system is based on the fact that the work is carried out exclusively in the trend on M5-M30 TF. Limit losses is one of the most important components of the trading system. Stop loss orders (orders limiting potential losses) are always. Possible loss ratio and the expected profit is from 1/3 to 1/7 and sometimes more. In the trading system using the author's indicator, which allows to enter the market at the beginning of the wave. This is a huge advantage. Trading system was made to minimize losses and gives the maximum profit.

The main reference point for the analysis of the position opening acts Murray levels on different timeframes - usually on the H1 - H4. When working with the levels of each of Murray's lines constructed indicator has its own name (Major Support / Resistance (Large support / resistance), Overshoot (overflow), Extreme Overshoot (Max overflow), and so on). Each title somehow captures the essence of the level and can serve as a benchmark for opening / closing position. Separately dwell on the description of each level do not see the need, since their values are already subscribed to the chart. Particularly important are the levels: 0/8, 4.8, 8.8. They are marked in blue. Typically, about which there is a change tendency, especially when viewed at large halves - H4.

It's a great thing to be a trader, i can called it a business. Yes it's a business cause trade about buy or sell, so simple. In my mind it's simple but it need skill to choose a good and profitable decision, and equity is everything for me, that's the important rule and point and i believe there's no need tehnical or fundamental thing when you focus to your account equity.

.При положительной корреляции, на одной валютной паре открываем ордер на покупку, а на второй на продажу, таким образом мы можем фиксировать прибыль, когда общая прибыль выше убыточной, но в любом случае будет прибыль. Открываю 2 позиции... Из-за особенностей валютной политики стран Еврозоны и Австралии, при росте доллара в валютной паре EUR/USD на 100 пунктов, AUD/USD рост составит порядка 65-80 пунктов. То же и при падении стоимости доллара. средняя прибыль 10-35 пунктов.При переносе позиции на следующий день.мы имеем положительный своп.

Dear followers: this account opens maximum 2 trades and need 1600 pips as your capital...dd maximum 220pips........to earn money in forex you need more patience and calculate your income annually.once again don't have patience don't invest...........Good Luck!
I am full time trader and I spend a lot of time analyzing market. Vast majority of my trades are technical in nature. I like to have predefined parameters before entering a trade. That does not mean they are set in stone, there is some flexibility to it once the trade is live, but I have a very good idea of what I want to accomplish. In addition, risks are also defined. However, I am aware of major fundamental news releases, the ones that have potential to move markets. I avoid trading before them, in particular trying to predict their outcome, but sometimes I trade right after that when I know outcome date. But For example, interest rates decisions by central banks almost always create volatility. Some traders place orders before these events, first trying to guess what the announcement brings and THEN how markets will react. As far as I am concerned, this is pure guesswork. That said, new trends may emerge after key news releases and on occasions I trade them once a direction has been established, which is at least 15 minutes after the event. Breaking news is somewhat different animal, which I try to exploit only it causes a move that lines up with existing technical picture. On balance, 90%+ of my trades are technical. I hope you will respect my job. Trust me, I will gain a lot of pips. Best wishes to all.

I have many years of experience in foreign exchange, to become the strategy also have a period of time, more familiar with the direct trading, these accounts generally do AUD\/USD, GBP\/USD, EUR\/USD, occasionally do some crosses, half don't stay alone at night, place an order of not more than 8, and strive to every profit more than 50 points, the appropriate time to stop, control in 150 points.
Trading is simple. But keeping it simple is the hardest thing. CPFX Trend is my own definition about trend in FOREX. Follow it, make pips and have fun! H1 is minimum timeframes. But I prefer to trade H4 based on D1/W1/MN trend. Risk is always less than reward. Instant profit!
I am a professional trader with long-term experience in FX markets. My strategy is from the daily technical and trend-line analysis and I pursue scenario trading method based on Elliot wave principle and trend-line analysis. Simply, I open position only with high probability based on strict risk management. For your understanding, Swing trading is for maximizing the gain when you get the proper trend and short-term trading is for earning profit from daily fluctuation on charts. These both strategies will work together for continuing profitable trading with low risk. I hope you bring successful trading performance with me.

I think it is true, that no one is always right in making predictions, and errors are frequent traders are emotional factors. I tried to manage the emotions as much as possible. in my analysis combines several techniques to look for trends, after finding the trend of a few options and then selecting one of the best, when to enter the market to bring a conviction, despite market ups and downs I remain calm,Put our experience to work and join us in this adventure as we navigate the global FX market. good luck.

This system is very simple, only using price action and a few basic indicators to make technical analysis. The system will spot direction of the 5M trend and follow it. maximum 10 trades open at the same time. Better you lower your lots than limit the maximum trades, because we don't know which trade will be loss and which trade will be profit. Thank you for your trust. I will not be responsible for people that try to over-trade and have loss.

The Xhosa Complete strategy is as indicated in the title a complete system . This means it has a pre determined stop loss and profit target creating set and forget trades. System is 100% mechanical using a vast array of technical indicators which determine entries. Always use proper money management! UPDATE: I've tweaked the system slightly to defend against green positions turning red. This includes several volatility and momentum calculations and will differ from trade to trade.

This trader does not have an approved description yet.
- this investment strategy includes a discretionary approach i.e. trading decisions are based on proprietary indicators in combination with a personal evaluation of the current market situation and trade-related movements of the currency pair a signal has presently been generated for. A main timeframe is a focus point for directional predictions, subcycle-trends are being noticed as well. - the trading system is aiming at a medium term step by step growth so that simultaneous risk control can be more manageable especially in times of unusal or impulsive market behaviour. SL and TP levels are partly software-controlled, positions may be closed any time before reaching a set SL or TP level. - more than 15 years of experience of trading stocks, the futures market and forex are additional fundaments of the strategy.

Estrategia con un amplio margen riesgo beneficio, Esta estrategia es rentable con baja tasa de aciertos. Utiliza stop y la relación riesgo beneficio es muy elevada. Deja correr beneficios en busca de tendencias extremas y prefiere cerrar en negativo antes de tomar pequeñas ganancias con tal de dejar correr la posición. Se opera muy poco apalancado y no se sobreopera.

My strategy involves: (1) Trading with the trend and never against it-I pick trend from monthly, weekly and daily chart (2) I use stop loss and take profit all the time (3) Risk: Reward-1:3 to 1: 5-Take profit is always bigger than stop loss (4) Trailing stop is always applied (every 15mins) (5) Pairs to trade-A mixture of different pairs (6) Maximum open trades will be 3-5 (7) Diversified-Different pairs open at the same time.

Работаю по двум стратегиям. Первая стратегия предусматривает внутри дневной скальпинг с максимальной прибылью в 20 - 30 пипсов. Вторая стратегия предусматривает трендовые - длинные позиции, которые длятся от 2 дней и больше с целью получить от 200 до 500 пипсов прибыли. Торгую со стоп лосами. Использую глубокий технический, фундаментальный анализ и волновой принцип Эллиота . Данные две стратегии мною были протестированы более чем 6 месяцев и прибыль по которым составила 75%. Так же, Уважаемые подписчики на мои сигналы, советую Вам не спешить закрывать вручную сделки. Дождитесь, пока это сделаю я сам. Прошу Вас довериться мне и я Вам принесу прибыль.

hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk. Variables such as the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses as well as maintaining adequate liquidity are material points which can adversely affect actual real trading results.

The essence of the trading system is based on understanding of a wave situation in the market and at end of this or that model entry point search in the market begins. Each wave has an initial and final point in the price and time. The model is continuous that at the end of one wave the beginning of the next wave is noted. The main model consists of five separate waves which are connected with each other and make progress as market movement of the price up or down. This five-wave sequence, has digital marking with 1 on 5, is called as motivating (operating) wave because they move the market in the direction of the main trend. Each wave 1, 3, and 5 also are motivating waves. In turn waves 2 and 4 called correcting (counteracting) waves because they interrupt movement of the main trend and develop it in the opposite direction. Maximum 1 position the same time.

I am an experienced professional trader and very familiar with trading at Zulutrade. This signal provider account has undergone a re-design in December 2013 and is my best attempt at an optimal setup to properly trade the world's Forex markets. Please properly follow this account. I'm not afraid to cut losers and take necessary losses when conditions warrant it and I do not average down endlessly during draw down in attempts to salvage a winning position. I believe will allow me to accurately use position sizing percentages and techniques that I use in my own accounts. This should optimize the risk/reward ratio that you as followers feel you are getting in your accounts and maintain a steadily growing equity curve. I want to earn your trust and I believe that the true power of trading is in being consistent and letting profits compound. Let's capture some profits!

Hi, with over 4 years of experience in the Forex market. Trade intraday on EU, GU and AU. My strategy is follow trend with the stop loss of 100 pips, maximum 10 trade will be open in any currency. Expected to achieve revenues in the each month of 10-25% profit. Good luck!

Dear Followers. I will continue the same trading strategy to follow the short trend of EURUSD. I will watch closely for a potential pullback.
Dear Reader, We took some losses and that really sucks sorry for this situation and drawdown. Should have taken profit on EUR/USD trades and not opened new ones before FOMC. Still have same long term expectations. USD/JPY target 125 EUR/GBP target under 0,7 EUR/USD 1,03 and eventually parity or below that. Greets
I have a style that takes small bites of the Forex markets movements to achieve a monthly gain that is safe from heavy loss. I first analyze for the big trend and only trade with it. A greed free process that goes for the mid-section of every move( not trying to get in early or stay in to the end) gives you a shot at steady growth. Using sound cash management to stay far from margin issues and looking for the sure thing is the style of a timid trader however it is also the style of a trader who wants to be there trading after the bold traders have all lost their money. Cash management should be no more than 1 micro lot (10 cents per pip) for every $200 in your account. this will keep you from a margin call and still allow for a steady growth. This also protects you when a draw-down happens and they will sometimes. I will not be responsible for people that to over-trade and have loss.

Regards! Trading strategy is most effective for a time-frame H1. Opening of the trade most often occurs when the price of a batted 8th EMA (as it may be other lines that previously found support price), confirmation system MACD, and confirmation candle figure. Spark must fend off the line EMA, or to break it from the bottom (top) and attach it with the next candle should be the same color as the candle is broken (repulsed). The exceptions are the figures MACD: head and shoulders, double top and hollow, round tops and bottoms.

This period of time is changing with market condition. The goal of this strategy is to find a rhythm of change of the market.

Trading predominantly with pending orders and with a take profit and a stop loss always set. Any currency pairs could be traded but the majors are preferred. Complying with the FIFO rule and does not hedge FIFO. All signals are sent from an MT4 platform. Good luck to all followers.
Money management in Forex (as well as in other financial markets) is a complex set of rules which you develop to fit your own trading style and amount of money you have for trading. Money management plays very important role in getting profits out of Forex; do not underestimate it. Even if you master every possible method of market analysis and will make very accurate predictions for future Forex market behavior, you won't make any money without a proper money management strategy.While learning a lot about market analysis and money management is an obvious and necessary step to be a successful Forex trader, you also need to master your emotions to keep your trading performance under strict control of mind and intuition. Controlling your emotions in Forex trading is often a balancing between greed and cautiousness. Almost any known psychology practices and techniques can work for Forex traders to help them keep to their trading strategies rather to their spontaneous emotions.

I have been trading since 2008, and my trading strategy is mainly to trade engulfing candles on the 5 minute chart. I will aim for 1:1 profit to start, with a stop loss set at 3-5 pips above or below the engulfing candle, or the recent high/low. My strategy yeilds a 56% success rate on backtesting, and roughly 90 pips per week on the GBP/USD, EUR/USD & USD/JPY Forex Markets, and I aim bring between 20-100 pips a week, with very little risk, and very little drawdown. I will use a trailing stop once the 1:1 profit has been made, and then let the trade ride until an opposite signal is provided to get out or a support structure is reached. Due to the nature of the trailing stop, there will be some break even trades, but these are necessary for money management, and steady growth. I will never open more than 2 positions at a time, and my maximum stop loss ever will be 75 pips per trade, but mainly will be around 10-20 pips to enable a low drawdown with an NME under $200. I will trade during 8am til 8pm on most weekdays, when the spreads are low, and markets are most acitve. The amount of trades per day, depends on the amount of signals on any given day, which on backtesting is between 2-7, and averaging at around 5. This is a solid strategy, and I hope we can make a steady and low risk profit together. All the very best, Mark.

Dear followers! This strategy is similar to ZeusSystem, but it has some significant differences (although, much of ZeusSystem recommendations are applicable to this system).

This is just a reminder of my strategy. The employment report of the United States was announced last Friday. Before it, I closed all the positions, and I open positions again after it. I make profits by technical analysis not by fundamental analysis. I try to close all positions to avoid possible big loss before important fundamentals are announced, or not to hold positions on the day. I will do it especially for the employment reports of the major currency’s countries.

This is no get rich fast signal! My strategy focusses on short-term trading based on Expert Advisors. I limit the number of simultaneous trades to maximum two at a time and one trade per curreny pair. About 30 to 60 trades per month and on average 50 pips per winning trade. I constantly use S/L and aim at 1000 pips per month. The signal is especially suited to medium size accounts and mid-term following for a month and longer.

Hello ,This is a very safe strategy with 100-120 pips Stop Loss , and i don't open more than 2 positions in the same time . I usually trade all the Major currencies , My strategy depends on technical analysis and some combined indicators , I have been trading this strategy since 3 years. good luck
Maximo DD 200 pips. Trato de subirme a una tendencia para obtener grandes ganancias. Pero estas oportunidades no abundan por lo que en periodos de tiempo las ganancias por operaciones son normales. Si bien me utilizo análisis técnico en tiempos de tantos acontecimientos económicos el análisis fundamental es muy importante. En el pasado tuve abundante ganancias pero eso depende de oportunidades que no se dan frecuentemente por lo que es de esperar que el ritmo de ganancias sea menor, al histórico.

一次性開單最多十單，關注歐元和英鎊

Very clear with my strategy . no strange trades. Don't trade too often as I use daily tf but when I get a strong signal I get aggressive . my aim is to make abt 80% gains every year . that's almost double amount . I trade mostly with yen .
The strategy is based on the parabolic indicator SAR, and watching the economic news of the day. Used sparingly partially Martingale strategy. Used for trading time frame - M 15. Just use RSI indicator. Relative Strength Index (RSI from the English. Relative strength index) - an indicator of technical analysis, which determines the strength of the trend and the likelihood of change. Number of points profit - (10-20).

Hi AAA1267812F since there are good followers who made money from my trades because of their money management.. i posted lots of times in my updates regarding money management.. its followers mistake who takes higher risk.. No trader will be 100% successful.. even though i managed the draw down and i recovered it now i made 700+ net pips in March.. check my performance.. I already told to followers to do not follow me if they are taking more than 1% risk per trade and don't have patience..

:: Trading strategy using quantitative, technical and fundamental analysis. :: Maximum Drawdown Risk = 100% (All equity at risk). :: Probability of monthly account blowup = 5-10% (Expect a 100% drawdown 1 out of 10-20 months). :: EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, USDCAD and AUDUSD pairs only. :: Withdraw your profits each month and trade only what you can afford to lose. If I win, you win and if you lose, I lose also so need to complain.

Manual Trade. Open position:1-2.Often make judgments based on financial news, and send signals. When the vehicle lost brake function, it is completely out of control, the consequences would be fatal. This market is the same reason. Controlled stop, the foundation is our money, in order to ensure that our money is safe, then we will have the opportunity to win more money.GOOD LUCK.

Hello friends, I'll open a maximum of 6 positions. I only trade gbp-usd and eur-usd. Rarely open 6 positions, but it happens. When I open a position, I am ALWAYS behind my laptop, so my positions rarely last longer open 24 hrs. My stop loss is never greater than 100 pips, but usually not fixed immediately to protect a slippage, however, my stop will never be greater than 150 ... My drawdown never be greater than 350. I will generate between 250 and 600 pips per week.

i didnt do anything wrong about money management (last losses)... i said before (at my strategy description) my highest stop loss is all my trading life about -350 pips right ? and i said you should set ur account for let 1 position for every 2000 dollars (1 pip = 1 dollar) ( if you just follow me )... noone can accurate at market %100...if you know anyone like that please tell me and i wont look screen anymore...if followers would do what i say their losses wouldnt be that much...its not rocket science you should just set ur size like what i say or dont blame me...my acurrate is about %80-90 and i can recover my losses everytime...but even you have %99 accurate and if you dont have any stop loss rule that %1 loss can melt your whole account...the important thing is you should accept sometimes you can be wrong about your position (even sometimes its a bull or bear trap) good luck everyone !

Carney, Yallen, Draghi speak today hmm.. interesting
All our trading is manual trading. Trades are initiated predominantly on longer term support and resistance levels, and supported by a range of other technical indicators. We trade using both the longer term and shorter term time intervals, generally in a trend following capacity for longer time trades and where it seems appropriate, counter the trend for shorter term trades.
This weeks is being a bit harder than the others, and actually Tritrader has a Draw Down because some trades became in losses because I decided to close them, as I was not sure about them. However, you don't have to worry about this. It's always better to close strategies losing some pips than destroying accounts and generating a disaster with a hugh Draw Down. It's not possible to win 100℅, but the important is to close trade when needed. Just be patient, green trades will come back. TriTrader.

Hedge strategy based on the Adaptive Volatility Hedger EA wich you can find on the web, trading all the majors and hedging all the losses in order to have a reduced drawdown and a high percentage of winning trades. Max open trades 3, maybe 4, trading GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDCAD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDJPY. We developed our algorithm (The Adaptive Volatility Hedger) in order to achieve steady capital growth and limited drawdown: our EA was finely tuned within the last 15 years of data giving us great results, but even if backtest results are quite impressive and manual intervention is -frankly speaking- unnecessary, to let you sleep well we'll check regularly our ea activity multiple times each day, especially during important news. We are a small team of traders seriously committed to trading and we'll do everything we can to maximise your profits and protect your capital! On top of that, be advised that since our EA uses just pending orders, our strategy is Slippage-Free... even more pips for you! Thank you again for following us! Grazie!

Now I have +7804 pips profit with only 121 pips DrawDown.I think thats pretty cool.Check out my system




Political and economic changes are the basis here as they affect currency prices; moreover, technicals are used for timing and to manage risk precisely. We only want to focus on trades that offer 1-to-2 risk-to-Reward ratio or greater. Meaning now, we only need to have one winning trade for any two given losers to be break even to net profitable on our trading account. Trade setups are determined by a combination of key reversals, support/resistance holds, support/resistance breaks, support/resistance re-tests. Always using Stop-Loss and Limit orders from the beginning. This allows to use the proper risk/reward ratio from the outset. Once set, we never touch them (One exception: we can move stop in our favor to lock in profits and minimize risk as the market moves in our favor). The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss in excess to your investment; please ensure you fully understand the risks. NOT risking to losing more than 1-1.5% of your capital per trade + be DISCIPLINED and PATIENT.

The strategy principles in a simplified form, the of construction levels imbalance prices, by which we will determine the strength of buyers and sellers. The strategy is most effective for determining the correction or turn on any instruments traded on any time-frame on the stage of formation. Trade is possible as the trend and against the trend. Determination of imbalance occurs on the timeframes H1-H4. Take into account the direction of the trend and levels of large timeframes at the entrance to the small timeframes. An important rule is the presence of the reaction in the level of imbalance when prices approach. Cover only the levels of imbalance. Upward trend in the price level offers a large timeframe (possible reversal of trend). Waiting formation level of supply on a smaller time frame.

The open trades most of the time is between 5 and 10, but rarely it can go up to the maximum of 30 positions. I'm always use a stop loss, and mostly a take profit levels. It’s highly recommended that you create a demo account first to follow these signals, and if you get comfortable with the results, then go ahead and follow with your real account. Please take care of your money management as its one of the main keys in this industry, and please stay optimistic. All the best and enjoy the profits.

Let's hope this is just a pull-back in the down-trend. Either way please don't lecture us as that's not what you are paid for. The only thing that matter is making money, not being right. You can only make money if you manage and minimize draw-down, which right now you are not doing!
My new investment strategy; Under fundamental analysis, judgment-based,reference technical indicators to operate. Each time positions 5,stop loss and win will make decisions based on the actual market situation. I will pay particular attention to risk control. Also, under uncertain circumstances i will reduce operations, or even stop the operation. When the situation is more clear.
I use graph time fame 15 minute. I find the graph consolidation and draw the rectangle. If price go down and break the rectangle line I will open sell order but if price go up and break rectangle line I will open buy order. I take profit around 10-100 pips and stop loss 50-75 pips

Bonjour Madame, Monsieur, - Selon votre courtier je vous conseil un apport minimum de 5 000 Euro, car je trade avec 0.5 lots et donc il faut une marge suffisant. - Je peux ouvrir jusque maximum 20 lots sur la même devise. - Je réalise essentiellement des trades sur l'EUR/USD, car la stratégie fonctionne parfaitement avec cette devise. Explication de ma stratégie : Ne chercher pas à comprendre les trades ouverts, car la stratégie est de brouiller les pistes sur le vrai trade et pour cela je réalise plusieurs trade sur la même devise (il y a des trades perdant, mais qui serve à brouiller les pistes). Lorsque tous les trades sont fermé le résultat finale, par rapport au capital de départ, est toujours positive si vous respecter ma stratégie !!!!!!!!!!!. Cordialement, Le Breiz

This is a professional trading system which trades on EUR/JPY, based on technical analysis. Maximum number of open positions at any point of time will be 2 (the profile page shows max open position as 3 because when I close 2 open positions and open 1 position through stop and reverse approach at the same price and same time, technically it gets considered as 3 open positions). Every position will have maximum stop loss of 150 pips. Thus in worst case scenario the Maximum Draw Down will never exceed 300 pips. Trades will be entered by opening 2 positions at the same time. One of the position will have a fixed take profit target and the other position will be managed as per the unfolding price action. Trades may even be exited before Stop loss or profit target is hit. No positions will be carried through the weekend. Protecting the capital of my followers is my prime responsibility, thus I will never resort to reckless trading. All trades will be executed exactly as per parameters outlined in this strategy description. Followers are requested to adjust their position sizes accordingly as per their individual risk tolerance.

La estrategia se basa fundamentalmente en la Acción del Precio (Price Action). Busco los principales soportes y resistencias en las diferentes temporalidades para decidir si entrar o no en una operación, y cuándo hacerlo. Trataré en lo posible evitar las operaciones que sean de largo plazo, salvo que sean evidentemente rentables. También trataré de mantener abiertas simultáneamente 3 operaciones como máximo, salvo que aparezca alguna operación que justifique su apertura. Espero resultarles de provecho

Trading, not gambling is the key of this system. Thank you in advance for you're confidence and trust !

This trader does not have an approved description yet.
This strategy is based on pivot points and ADX. It's symple but effective. Only ONE trade at same time. There is going to be take profit and stop loss, ALWAYS. Both are configured in 20-80 pips. As you can see this is not a trade and pray game. Good trades.
In this system, some automatic strategies are running on an MT4. 10 automatic strategies are constantly running on another account. Backtests are made regulary with new strategies. Based on the results, the best performing EAs (4-5 pieces) run on this account. The portfolio is reviewed monthly , and if necessary it is amended. Currency pairs: EURUSD , GBPUSD , USDJPY
Afrina is manual trading system based on many technical analyst, and completed by fundamental analyst. It uses dynamic target profit and manual stop loss level (maximum risk 10%). Our commitment is to continuously brings positive result for all subscribers at every month-end while our monthly expected return target is 10-20% of balance. Afrina is not perfect trading system but it will try it best to be a long last profitable system. I act only with positive expected value. Principle: let profits run, cut losses, This also means that I do not run behind every opportunity. Trades are only taken if the risk is clearly calculated.

Hello every body, i'm happy to see that some of you are following my system instructions and having good results. I know August wasn't a good month but is normal, holydays for a lot of people. Now we are entering in September and will see the market better moves. Don't worry, be patience and the benefits will arrive. Good trading for all.
Levels, support lines and resistant lines, pin-bars. I trade on the H4 and D1 is very rare I go to H1, only when a good setup forms. Stop-loss is not large (40-100 points, it is 2-3% of the capital), that for high timeframes is very little. Also, a standard indicator MACD is used - it needs as an assistant in the detection of divergence. Opening of the transaction takes place by hand, but I also use limit orders. Profit is about 2-3 times more stop. Experience - 4 years. Уровни, линии поддержки и сопротивления, пин-бары. Торгую на H4 и D1 очень редко захожу на H1, только когда образуется хороший сетап. Стоп-лосс не большой (40-100 пунктов, это 2-3% от капитала), что для высоких таймфреймов весьма мало. Также используется стандартный индикатор MACD - нужен как помощник в обнаружении дивергенции. Открытие сделки происходит в ручную, но также использую лимитные ордера. Прибыль, примерно, в 2-3 раза больше стопа. Опыт - 4 года.

Durante il nostro trading quotidiano, lo stop loss ci aiuta a contenere le perdite e a lavorare in maniera ordinata e proteggere il nostro capitale. Non bisogna vedere lo stop loss come un nemico della nostra operatività.

I have over 6 years of experience and my trading strategy of Scalping to a few pips all currencies The target for every positions about afew pips Stop lose is safe and Work on Frames 5 minutes and 15 minutes With suitable risk and Wish good luck for everyone .
n current trading system we first of all using news information taking into account huge amount of historical information and technical analysis. In current situation we are going to open not more than 2 positions. Every position will be protected by SL. So conservative strategy will be 500$ per 0.1 st lot.
Mostly following and Trading the NZD/USD, Taking profit of around 20-50 pips ideally. Will do about 1-5 trades at most, without stop loss, So manage your margins. May increase up to 10 Max, depending on the level of the NZD/USD I trade in my own time watching the charts not auto trading here Just one person making trades.
We wish to recover. We already gained some nice rank. Soon to go back to top 100s. Good Luck to both of us :)Satnam Shris Waheguru ji.
HBR is a simple trading system I’ve discovered based on 5 years of my experience in currency trading. Since I’m interested in price action, my strategy is quite simple, only the price in candle sticks combined with Moving average + MACD. I trade mostly on EUR/USD. The average risk/reward ratio is 1/1 or greater. All our positions have TP and SL. I may open a maximum of 6 trade. Our strength is to deliver consistent monthly return. Good Luck.

Важная поправка для подписчиков. Рамер лота рассчитываем исходя из максимальной просадки в 400 пунктов, это связано в первую очередь, с высокой текущей волатильностью. Так работая 0,01 лота, просадка составит 40$. Закладываем размер минимального лота и размер депозита относительно этой суммы. Так инветируя 400$ максимальная просадка составит 10%, Размер просадки каждый выбирает сам. В случае достижения просадки в 400 пунктов, торговля будет приостановлена. Возобновлю работу сразу как будут найдены слабые места в системе.

Риски 0.02 лот на каждые 100 $ вашего депозита.

This strategy is using lower time frame with 15-minute timeframe as our main chart.This is intra-day trading with technical short term trading.we are using technical indicator especially Moving Average as dynamic support and resistance. I trade with and against the trend. I trade in all currencies. I don't aim big profit but if there is a chance I will try to get it. My monthly target is about 200-300 pips with 2 positions. I recommend using a good financial management because it is the key to success in trading.

Hi every one, the strategy changed so if you want to know how you can take a look at the strategy description. So far so good. We had 2 sets of trades opened so far and the results are as expected: first set of trades comprised of 1 trade was a looser (approximately 72 pips lost here), the second one comprised of 21 trades was a winner (approximately 1370 pips won). As it can be seen we have small losses and huge wins. Good luck every one!

I am trading with caution after the recent losses. The current short EURAUD technically combines the big bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart, with recent fundamentals. The RBA was widely expected to lower cash rates but kept them steady at 2.25 percent, which should result in a decent AUD rally. The uncertainty surrounding the ECB and the Greek government should keep the EURO down, setting up a good trade. The target is the most recent pivot low support area around 1.3825. This is about 100 pips above recent major support from mid March making the target attainable. The stop will be trailed down should price go in our favor by a decent amount.

Ich verfolge die Kurse hauptsächlich im Monats-,Wochen und Tageschart und suche nach guten Einstiegsmöglichkeiten.Mein Handel erfolgt dann meist im Stunden- und 5 Minutenchart.Als Indikator nutze ich den Ichimoko.In der Regel handel ich in Richtung des Trends.Ich mache wenige Trades die ich laufen lasse und so versuche wenigstens 50 Pips zu machen.



This strategy uses a professional EA that I have developed myself. It trades 14 currency pairs simultaneously on the daily charts. All trades have a stoploss. some trades use a fixed take profit, other trades use a trailing stop. The EA uses 3 price action strategies (pinbars, inside bars and breakouts).


Hi followers, the gbp/usd is my favored currency pair at the moment we took back or losses, market remains choppy, and prices are not really trending at the moment. so we take profit and losses soon, thank you for you trust! Wish you all the best
the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk. Variables such as the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses as well as maintaining adequate liquidity are material points which can adversely affect actual real trading results.
My strategy departs of two parts. First saving, second developing. My special system provides signals and I will share them. I use Moving Averages and fibonacci levels. Sometimes I use other indicators and news events results. My strategy interested in low-risk, and profit-seeking stable monthly to investors. You will see I made pips.

Если система дает сигнал на совершение сделки, то самый лучший вариант - это когда сразу же после открытия позиции цена идет в нужном направлении. Чем больше времени пройдет до начала движения цены в нужном направлении, тем больше вероятность того, что на рынке произойдет нечто такое, что помешает цене пойти в нужном направлении. Удачи
For some people my trading style is not good because they are not earning millions in just one day. The profits they expect are not that great but they are not noticing the the risks are small eather.

Технический анализ и исследования динамики рынка теснейшим образом связаны с изучением человеческой психологии. Так,графические ценовые модели, которые были выделены и классифицированы в течение последних ста лет, отражают важнейшие особенности психологического состояния рынка. Прежде всего, они указывают, какие настроения бычий или медвежьи господствуют в данный момент на рынке. И если в прошлом эти модели работали, есть все основания предполагать, что и в будущем они будут работать, поскольку основываются они на человеческой психологии, которая с годами не меняется.

Dear followers, we had a difficult month and i had to concentrate on my trading and thats why i did not responded for a while here. We started bad and i had to bring those pipses back without having any distructions on my trading. Any comments from ammature traders deffinetly not helping, those followers are paniced when see a red deals, comment bad and seed a panic among other followers. After this they leave a SP with some loses, go to another SP who whill open 30-40 open trades in case of some DD and finaly blow the followers account and at the same time those followers miss all the recovery made by previous SP. I sayd a lot of times to think for a long term and i dont understand how some followers are making a conclusions after 1-2 weeks and even earlier. My friends we are talking about monthes and years here! I will stick to my strategie opening maximum 3 trades and keeping low DD. Please understand that if i am not making profit i do not get payd so it is our mutual interest to make profit. I will trade the same way in the future, please understand that DD in forex is a part of a bussiness, it happened before and will happen again but what metters is a long term gain. For some followers i answer-i do pay attention to the news. The red start of a month was totally unpredicted. The USA news were bearish, Draghi was bearish, all Euro economics were bearish and still it was a huge uptrend because of the oil. we can not predict it all. It is easy to sit near the formed grafth and say why dont u sell at the top and bought at the bottom? But bellieve me no one trader in the world knows exactly when the market at the top and when is not. We only know this on retro revew of the market. Proper money management and sticking to a good strategie is the key to succesese and i whill act according to those rules in the future. My friend we are in the same bote and we have a great journey ahead of us. Beliieve in me and i will make my best for you in the future and bring you

Nouveaux followers bonjour, j'ai gardé des positions haussières car je pense que le marché €/$ vient de se retourner à la hausse, ce qui explique ma baisse de rendement ces derniers jours. Je ne vends donc pas mes positions haussières pour le moment. Par contre, je les vendrai que si la perte est minime ou si l'€ passe sous 1.1060 $
This week finished with 0.5% gain to the account. Our first buy trades hit SL ( -1%) and the sell trades got triggered. They only went in DD of 4 pips. The second trade was only the spread away from hitting TP but we closed it at .78583 this morning after it came back for the second time (only 3.5 pips away from the TP). The sell trades gave us almost 1.5% gain to the account so this week finished with 0.5% gain total or 38 pips. We are done for the week. See you all next Monday when we will be looking for our next setup.

Update 29/09/2014: Innanzitutto grazie a tutti coloro che hanno creduto in me, ero sicuro della risalita dell' euro. Per quanto riguarda le posizioni ancora aperte sto monitorando la situazione e comunque con chiusura minima a 1.61. La mia attenzione adesso è rivolta al GBPNZD che si avvicina al massimo storico e al Rublo anch'esso al massimo storico. Grazie
Главное не спешить и не дергаться.Прежде чем начать торги,тщательно просмотреть и проанализировать по большее количество предыдущих.Ни в коем случае не ставить с первой минуты.Какое то время последить за интересующими вас позициями и постепенно начинать торги.Не надо вводить больше половины,а лучше не больше четверти счета и не надо сразу закрывать при резком небольшом понижении или повышении.

The main purpose of modeling is an attempt to create a forecasting model to predict the market assets quotes values. However all attempts for prolongation of accumulated and operational experience have not lead to success. Nevertheless, the attempts to find the stock trading Philosopher's Stone are continued and lead to formation more and more complex models.
My investment goal is to have 100-500 points profit per month. I will set a stop loss of about 60 points, then combined with fundamental and technical to operate. My take profit point will be relatively small, but I will strive to achieve stable profitability, to obtain the final victory in the accumulation. I believe that it is less risky and stable earnings strategy. Thanks!
I trade most currency pairs. Max open positions 3. Stop loss and take profit set on all trades. I trade taking into account long term trends. I do use indicators to confirm a trade before I take it to establish stop loss. Take profit can be shifted during trade depending on market information.


Здравствуйте, уважаемые гости и инвесторы! Торговлей на валютном рынке занимаюсь уже более трех лет. Основная масса торговых операций производится внутри дня, но возможен и перенос сделок на следующий день. Торговая стратегия трендовая, основана на техническом анализе с использованием скользящих средних. Максимально возможное количество окрытых позиций - 3. Максимальная просадка по всем позициям - не более 200 пунктов. Наличие ордера Stop-Loss обязательно. Stop-Loss устанавливается в момент совершения сделки или незамедлительно после ее совершения и может перемещаться . Наличие ордера Take-Profit не считаю обязательным, поскольку иногда это препятствует получению большей прибыли. Рада буду сотрудничать с Вами!

Estrategia basada en operar posiciones extremas de la media buscando amplios recorridos y pares con mucho momentum. Se opera con stop y pueden abrirse en un momento dado hasta 9-10 posiciones y intentando no superar en conjunto un DD del 5% de la cuenta. Todas las posiciones se gestionan con stop dinámico. Se recomienda un lotaje de 0.1 lotes por cada 10000€. de esta manera la peor perdida será como máximo de aproximadamente 150€ por cada 10000€.

Year of trading and improving my skills on a real account with a real money.Only after a am positive that my trading works and works good i can shear it with you my dear followers. If you like my trading come and join me and i will stay with my trading strategie without changing it.
Our trading system based on successful technical analysis, the number of investment portfolio.We are trading major pairs only. Maximum trades per day is 8. Stop loss is mostly used to avoid market falls so it is not telling about risk/award because most of the trades are closed much before hitting the stop loss. The profit depends on the market volatility and combines short and long term orders.
I am a professional forex trader for the last 10 years and i want to shere my knowledge with you my dear followers. Years of trading helped me realize that the only way to make money in forex is by sepperating etomions from trading so i am trading manualy but like a robot no metter what happens. Try my trading style and you will not be disapointed.
Hello my dear followers! I invite you to try my trading strategie that combines technical and fundamental anylisys on the major pairs bounded to the USD. I also use overbuy and oversell lines together with short term positions and long term following the trend. Please set your stop loss to 150 pips and maximum open positions to 10. My goal is stably growth and safe money making for you.


Trading pair EURUSD only, positions are always with stop limits, usually 110-120 pips, max.150 pips. Moustly 1-3 open positions in the same time, maximum 5. The graph shows the income in pips and does not suffer from the different size of lots. Best regards, SystemsFX
Hi Everyone, my strategy is very simple. approx. 1 - 2 trades per day only on Eur/Usd . I ALWAYS USE A STOP LOSS, between 30 - 60 pips approx. My profit target is around 30 - 60 pips as well (maybe higher). Nice SAFE trading with minimum risk and consistent gains. I also NEVER hold trades over the weekend. Thank you for reading.
I will be trading as follows: 1. maximum of 2 positions , never to open both positions at same time. 2. never averaging trades , i.e opening the second position on losing position. 3. always opening the second position if there is more room in the market for a big jump. 3. maintaining the stop loss to a maximum of 80 pips. 4. using high / low strategy in predicting the market . 5. quantitative analysis , market news significant measurement , candle sticks measurement in predicting the next move. 6. Never gambling on news , rather waiting patiently for the news to be released and then decide about a trade. 6. trends , channels , elliot waves , pivot points & fibonnaci to be given extra concern. 7. rsi , slow stochastic and macd as my lagging indicators. 8. moving in and out of the market at times. i.e short term trading and or swing trading.

Estrategia de riesgo medio, utilizando análisis técnico y fundamental. Todas las operaciones son protegidas con una orden de stop loss, muchas veces las operaciones terminan en perdida, y la recuperación demora un par de días. El objetivo son 100 pips por semana, tratando de mantener una pérdida máxima no mayor a 150 pips.
My system has been tested for many years and, the results or very good. My strategy is based on support and, resistance. Is a concept in technical analysis that the movement of the price of a security will tend to stop and reverse at certain predetermined price movement, areas of supply and demand. This is the most important aspect of trading.
This is a mixed forex strategy focusing on solid and continued growth. I have risk management implemented. Trading on trending currency pair identified in the mid / long run. Trading is done on MT5 with some proprietary momentum based indicators and chart analysis. I am a full time trader since 2.5 years. Send me a message for more information.
The Euro accelerated lower against the US Dollar after producing a bearish Dark Cloud Cover candlestick pattern. Near-term support is at 1.0640, the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion, with a break below that on a daily closing basis exposing the 1.0456-1.0513 area (March 16 low, 50% level). Alternatively, a turn back above 1.0868 (38.2% Fib retracement, trend line support-turned-resistance) clears the way for a test of the 1.0995-1.1040 zone (50% threshold, March 18 high) Prices are too close to support to justify entering shortin line with our long-term outlookfrom a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will remain flat for now and wait for an actionable opportunity to present itself.

Dear followers if you wants to follow my trades just follow all trades why because then only i could able protect your capital ( i am very conservative on my account balance) just have a patient and belief definitely we will get success

The only way is the way to safe direction. The news is the first source, with parallel use with Indicators and the analysis which they are provide. Just do not increase your lot too much, keep it low, always depends from your fund. Choose lower lot than less positions. The positions are going to be as less as possible, to avoid the DD. The target is to open and close the trades possitive, with satisfied pips and in a short time.
I have 24 open positions right now (In red blood color), this 24 positions will be close by the market, not for me, this mean that i do not changue the S&L or Take profit values fixed in this 24 trades. By other side, i have the chance to open 6 more positions to continue with my account active. Thank you for your visit to my account.

There will be less frequent trading during the holiday period. I noticed people closed trades before I do. My stop loss is between 80 and 200 pips and following me all the way down there to only take +/- 25 pips on profitable trades can not be successful. The gbpjpy had a lot more potential than 118 pips and reversed quick. There will always be losing trades and the stop loss limits our losses on a single trade. As always use wise money management as I can not manage your account. Hopefully we can get a trade or two in the coming week.

The strategy provides for profit in the long term. The strategy allows a large number of open positions in the long term, so please use a minimum lot size and allow all trades. In general, one side open positions amount not more than 15. Per year on average earned 15000 pips profit. Trading currency pair is USD/CAD.
2015-03-19 Hello guys, what a excited day, no matter what Yellen says, EUR, AUD, CHF will still go down for quite a while. I actually open few short positions between 1.07~1.09 on EURUSD on my live account. Please don't forget Europe is under QE, and demand on mining-related stuff is still low. That's why both EUR and AUD will go down. I know most my followers' account got blow up, that's because you didn't do your proper money management. I would not long on EURUSD just because Yellen doesn't want to raise rate, it would make EURUSD go for a hike, but it will still go down eventually, it's a matter of time.

This trader does not have an approved description yet.
I invest rather in logn terme(4hours, 1day chart) like equity shares, because the spread is too big and scalping food only finance institutions. When I invest on long term a can invest not only on main pairs but also on pairs with bigger spread. Check me and invest with me.
Using pure price action and manual observation, I have created a discretionary system that works across all major forex pairs, using 30/60 min chart analysis while taking overall trend direction from the Daily chart. I have been trained by a well known price action trading guru who also specialises in developing the correct mindset for successful trading. Having traded now live for over 2 years, I usually achieve a typical strike rate of over 60% and compounded monthly account growth of at least 10% (based on record to date). I believe that the key to successful trading is managing risk, and not letting the risk ever be more than 1% per trade. There is NO SUCH THING as a “bet your house on it” type trade, and no one trade is worth increasing the % risk for, under ANY circumstances! I always follow the institutional money by trading as much as possible with impulsive waves, staying with the major trend defined by higher timeframes. I typically find up to 5 good trade set ups per week, most trades taking anything from a few hours up to around a day to complete. I generally don’t let trades run over a weekend, unless there is a really strong reason to do so. Profit targets and stop losses are clearly set at the start of each trade, with reward to risk ratios typically 1.5 to 1 or better. I use Forex Factory to keep my eye on major news announcements and ensure that they will have minimum impact on the pairs that are currently in a live trade setup. I don't usually have more than 2 trades open at the same time, which improves manageability and ensures a stealth like focus is maintained at all times on my trades. Come and join me on what promises to be a fantastic journey to profitability! Best Wishes to you all, Alastair.

minha estrategia e monitoramento de mercado com base no preço base das moedas no momento da ação fico de olhos abertos sempre buscando boas oportunidades no curto prazo espero que voces gostem dos meus serviços pois tudo que eu faço levo a serio não brinco em serviço amo operar no mercado de divisas.

My job it's to calculate every day the pivot point, median price and low and max of the day. That tell me where the price will go...or it will stay there in range mode. This system it's the ultimate machine that produce incredible result... guarantee on long term!!

I am an experienced professional trader and very familiar with trading at Zulutrade. This signal provider account has undergone a re-design in December 2015 and is my best attempt at an optimal setup to properly trade the world's Forex markets. Please properly follow this account. I'm not afraid to cut losers and take necessary losses when conditions warrant it and I do not average down endlessly during draw down in attempts to salvage a winning position. I believe will allow me to accurately use position sizing percentages and techniques that I use in my own accounts. This should optimize the risk/reward ratio that you as followers feel you are getting in your accounts and maintain a steadily growing equity curve. I want to earn your trust and I believe that the true power of trading is in being consistent and letting profits compound. Let's capture some profits!

This strategy is based on current market deviations. Strict stoploss in each pair allows to get low drawdown. I use seven pairs: EUR-USD AUD-USD GBP-USD USD-CAD NZD-USD USD-CHF . Trading is during all the sessions. Several signals may be during one day. I hope that you will enjoy my trading. Best regards and good luck.
система ручная полностью.
This system is primarily about keeping funds secure. We will open a max of 5 positions per pair. This is only on high conviction trades and stop losses will be around 20 pips with a max stop of 50 in some rare cases. We are here for the long run and all trades are monitored 24 hours a day. Good luck.

Welcome to the Investor, in connection with the highly unstable market, a change of strategy for greater safety up to the number of open positions at any one time is 5 greet
queto price has mystery truth ,my stratage can find this from a series of ask and bid price ,and dicide to trade ,every day may trade 10 times ,almost every order has positive profit ,you may follow in small money ,and do not use much amount ,you may close the order yourself ,if you think any order is wrong .
I have a style that takes small bites of the Forex markets movements to achieve a monthly gain that is safe from heavy loss. I first analyze for the big trend and only trade with it. A greed free process that goes for the mid-section of every move( not trying to get in early or stay in to the end) gives you a shot at steady growth. Using sound cash management to stay far from margin issues and looking for the sure thing is the style of a timid trader however it is also the style of a trader who wants to be there trading after the bold traders have all lost their money. Cash management should be no more than 1 micro lot (10 cents per pip) for every $200 in your account. this will keep you from a margin call and still allow for a steady growth. This also protects you when a draw-down happens and they will sometimes. I will not be responsible for people that to over-trade and have loss.

Fellow traders...please stay with the trades! Stay calm and trust the strategy which is very primal in trading dynamics...1) pick a very probable level of profitable entry 2. Scale in if necessary 3) Move out when its time to go. There is no secret sauce in trading..trader just has to really be two things: objective and a fighter by heart..no fear as long as strategy is still in play. Please stay with the trades guys and gals. Minimize your lot if need be. I am not interested in commission if i end up hurting your fund. I want you to make money off my trades. The way to achieve this is by having enough capital to support possible lots scaled in. If you must tradw with micro lots do so..my strategy has consistently kept me in top 50 for a while..not sure many have. Plan the trade. Trade the plan. Just food for thought.GL

The system trades the AUD/USD, EUR/USD,GPB/USD, USD/CAD and USD/JPY. It took over 2 years to develop the Ea. The EA is designed to trade across all sessions due to the diversity of the pairs traded. The strategy relies on the use of over a dozen of interconnected indicators that assess the direction and strength of each pair. There is a fixed take profit and stop loss level on all trades, however most trades are exited dynamically as the market changes. If the strength of a pair is showing signs a 40-50 pips is move achievable then it will let the profit run. Conversely if a pair quickly reverses, it will take profit of only a few pips. Very few trades result in significant draw downs.

The strategy is designed to work on any time intervals. It all depends on what phase is the market. Mechanical Advisor signals as the input and the output of the position. He at the same time looking for turning points in the last phase of the trend with mandatory supervision of trading volumes. Great importance is given to the rules and laws of conservation of capital and profits with respect to losses.
Strategy using a combination of moving averages, ADX, and Fractal indicators to determine entry points. Exit points are set by ATR indicator. This strategy may and often uses hedging positions to take profit positions. The are two sub-strategies depending on whether the market is ranging or trending, and it will swap between them to react to changing market conditions. This strategy can get into quite a high drawdown on some currencies from time to time, but the positions are managed, and come out profitable, so stay safe and keep the sizes low.

.Combination of trendline, effective support and resistance level, 50 SMA and current news. I always believe that risk management and money management is the key to earn money in Forex. . Indeed, the channel is in the process a lot of times players will see at certain levels of prices and carry out operations on the zig-zag-shaped movements of thn, then sharpen analysis to improve the caution, traders generally fall due imostly maintain a low drawdown, but don't get greedy and over lot size your trades. Practice safe money management and we'll be successful.The only way to minimize the losses is setting a reasonable stop loss.

Hello traders, good afternoon. Our stop PIPS will be stipulated as support and resistance, and subject the possibilities of changes in the market. Ranging from 50 to 500 stop PIPS. So my recommendation is to be released by each follower a minimum total of 10 positions for operating margin this provider. Then it must be released every $ 100, 1 position 0.01 mini-lot. Example: $ 100 = 1 position 0.01 mini lot. $ 1,000 = 10 positions 0.01 mini lot. $ 3,000 = 30 positions 0.01 mini lot. $ 10,000 = 10 positions 0.10 mini lots. $ 30 000 = 30 positions 0.30 mini lots. Please follow the instructions of the provider. Success to everyone. Regards, Rodrigo Messias

I have a simple trading checklist and i use it religiously. It’s not just about finding a trade and placing it, it’s about actually finding the right trades and then having confidence to pull the trigger. My simple checklist / plan will assist me in filtering good signals from bad signals, and will also hold me accountable. Correct money management parameters can be applied to my checklist. Focus on EUR.USD pair.
Уважаемые последователи! Я работаю объёмом. Кто-то делает одну сделку с объёмом один лот и ждет результат. Я же, такой объём (один лот) делю на сто сделок. И ввожу эти сделки в работу по разному… То есть, в работе может находится максимум сто сделок с объёмом 0,01 лота, что в сумме составит один лот. Второе, я исключаю маленький размер SL – это убивает депозит!!! При нормальной работе SL рассчитывается по дневным свечам, а это более 250 Pips.

Dear followers, I will combine more short-termed, defensive trades to stabilize the return. Regards,
Objective of my strategy is stable and reasonable growth exceeding long term interest rates with minimal risk. Draw down are always possible, but the main objective to preserve capital. I'm investing in all segments of financial markets, based on trend following strategies - entering positions when trend has been formed and exiting when there are signs of trend reversal (or sometimes simple stop loss).
Risk control on every order. No more than 3 orders in the same time. Thank you.

Уважаемые последователи! Я работаю объёмом. Кто-то делает одну сделку с объёмом один лот и ждет результат. Я же, такой объём (один лот) делю на сто сделок. И ввожу эти сделки в работу по разному… То есть, в работе может находится максимум сто сделок с объёмом 0,01 лота, что в сумме составит один лот. Второе, я исключаю маленький размер SL – это убивает депозит!!! При нормальной работе SL рассчитывается по дневным свечам, а это более 250 Pips. Вы должны правильно рассчитывать соотношение своего депозита к рабочему объёму суммы сделок и их общей максимальной просадки. Удачи в торговле!

Manually following the trend with the aid of technical indicators. Usually does not open so many trades at the same time just one or two trades per week. Stop loss may range between 45-120 pips per trade and depending on market conditions but usually not more while take profit also ranges between 45-120 pips. Trades only the major pairs.
Таймфрейм - M1. При помощи индикатора MACD определяю волну, при помощи индикатора AO определяю место нахождения в этой волне (волну в волне). При помощи индикаторов RSI и Stochastik нахожу вершину и делаю вход в рынок. Если первый вход был не удачным, то произвожу второй вход, а после третий и так далее. Рекомендуемые настройки счета: депозит – 100$; плечо – 1/100; сделка – три ; объем лота – 0.01. После того, как открыта позиция, брокер забирает свою маржу. Она составит 10$. Прохождение ценой расстояние 10 Pips составит 1$. Маленький SL быстро убьет депозит, поэтому я рассчитываю его как 1/10 часть депозита без маржи. То есть, депозит без маржи составит 70$. Значит, 1/10 часть составит, приближенно, 7$. Если перевести это в Pips получаем размер SL, равный 70 Pips (это оптимальный вариант для последователя, у меня могут быть другие варианты). Размер прибыли может быть различным. Все усредненные результаты отражены в статистике счета. Удачи в торговле!

Здравствуйте, уважаемые инвестори! Моя торговая система называется она Transient Zones или же «Переходные зоны». В ее основе лежит крайне мощная идея, поняв которую, я изменил свои взгляды на торговлю. Переходная зона (transient zone) – это зона, к которой не вернется ценовое движение, определяемое переменной h (число свечей до и после фокус-бара). Повторяющаяся зона (recurrent zone) – это зона, к которой вернется ценовое движение (ОНИ НЕ ЯВЛЯЮТСЯ ПЕРЕХОДНЫМИ).

Dear investors I am very concerned about the current state of Affairs. My position on AUD/USD was erroneous. Current positions on USD/CAD were opened taking into account the fundamental factor. Strategy of money management will be reviewed. Soon I will start to implement a script which automatically changes the SL by 1 point after reaching a certain level. This level will be determined from analysis of past transactions.

Greetings!started FX in 2009. Experienced so much success and failure, I concluded them to the algorithm used in this account. I can NOT make a big money by a single trade, but can make money in a long time span. If you want to follow me, try demo at least one month and follow my every single trade. thank you
My investment strategy : only GBP/USD currency pair max 3 open positions stop loss max 100 pips. Stop being greedy !! You can’t expect to double your money in 24-hour, day by day. The first lesson you must learn is to think in long-term categories. Therefore learn to pick the profitable traders and use the right money management. If you respect this, your are ahead of the others and you could make profits with Social Trading.

The trading strategy is most effective for determining the entry on any instruments traded mostly on a time-frame H1. Opening of the trade most often occurs when the price of a batted 8th EMA (as it may be other lines that previously found support price), confirmation system MACD, and confirmation candle figure. Spark must fend off the line EMA, or to break it from the bottom (top) and attach it with the next candle should be the same color as the candle is broken (repulsed). The exceptions are the figures MACD: head and shoulders, double top and hollow, round tops and bottoms.

We use technical analysis to trade Forex. We trade all the crosses. Elliot wave analysis is used as well. Trade with good risk management and don't invest what you can't to loose. We open trades in a 24 hour time frame so we might open a trade at any time. Good luck.
My strategy is using a few simple indicators plus some classical price patterns to trade and it's purely mechanical. This algorithm is working on all the main pairs and their crosses but I've chosen 17 from there. This is a multiple-pairs trading system that can open up to 17 pairs at the same time but I never risk more than 0.5 percent per order.

Dear followers, Simple strategy, opening only one position per pair. Limited risk, and operations only when setup trigger trigger. There may be a few days without operation. Patience is always the key to any market !! Let's ride the trend !! GO AHEAD !! .... GO FOR PROFIT...RISK LIMITED!! BE HAPPY!
I use candlestick as my main weapon. Combined with support and resistance concept and also the trend line. I use H4 time frame, so my position may be held for several days. But if I am lucky it can hit TP just in several hours. I always use fix take profit and stop loss, so that's safe to follow my trading.

Hello everyone,am Chris by name.Am a Professional technical FOREX trader.I come to you with six(6) years of practical experience in the FOREX market.I basically buy at the strongest support and sell at the strongest resistance.Am a long term and short term trader.I trade on the Daily chart but use the one hour chart for entry as this provides the perfect entry point and i then use the daily chart for exit point as this will lead to a smaller drawdown and very high profits on the long run.I trade manually.My Loss:Profit percentage basically is 1:5,or even more.This simply means that every major trade i win covers five of my losses.The Philosophy behind Successful trading is Money Management.I place stop loss immediately i open any position or positions,as this reduces any unprecedented or unexpected losses.I trade 20hours everyday so never worry because i monitor my trades almost round the clock. My strategy doesn't have a defined take profit,but has a defined stop loss which doesn't exceed 120pips maximum.My profit in a single trade can reach up to 500pips-1000pips.In some cases i hold open positions for weeks or months depending,with robust and serious profitability in terms of pips(sometimes i can have up to 5000pips in open positions or more).I will like to UNEQUIVOCALLY and UNAMBIGUOUSLY state here ,with every sense of sincerity and assurance that following my strategy and instructions will guarantee a 100% return every 3months maximum.This instructions can be found in my statues update. I assure you,with confidence and by God's GRACE that you are guaranteed a constant and un-fluctuating profit that is solid as a rock.CHEERS!!!!!

@ FXCM994183F.....i don't hedge.I only hedge on rare occasions.For example if am holding a buy long term position on Eur/Usd making like 400pips,and i detect a reversal or change of trend i will sell the pair and wait for a confirmation of the new trend.If its a fake trend and doesn't confirm,i will close the sell position and continue with the buy position.If its a true trend,i will close my buy position and hold the sell position.Hope you understand my explanation.

My investment goal is to have 100-500 points profit per month. I will set a stop loss of about 60 points, then combined with fundamental and technical to operate. My take profit point will be relatively small, but I will strive to achieve stable profitability, to obtain the final victory in the accumulation. I believe that it is less risky and stable earnings strategy. Thanks!
Ich handel hier nur die Paare die mit EUR und JPY zu tun haben. Ich handel nach der technischen Analyse und erreiche damit gute Ergebnisse. Meine 5 Jahre Erfahrung im Devisenhandel lassen für mich sprechen. Ich wünsche mir und Ihnen gute Trading Ergebnisse. Bitte bewerten Sie mich positiv und empfehlen Sie mich weiter. Vielen Dank schon mal im Vorraus.

Hello，everybody，in the past few years，I have developed my Forex Trading system. Now I trade assisted with EA, but not fullly by EA. I make trading dicision based on myself indicator, trace and protect my trade with EA. I am not a trader that pursues high success rate，but aimed at big chance with small cost.
Ya estaremos de nuevo operando normalmente retomando la estrategia ganadora del D1.
esfxEuro is managed full time by a professional trader with over 8 years of experience in various equities. Please review the following system information before investing. (Maximum stop loss: 15 pips) (Maximum positions: 1) (Weekly profit goal: 50 pips) Recommended minimum account value: Standard $5000, Mini $500, Micro $50 (Do not allocate more than 3% risk on a single position)
The strategy is based on grid micro-positions. We're seeking for suppressed currencies and possible forming of swing trades. Repetitive buy-on-dip opportunities offer a chance for grid position reloading. The strategy is quite profitable but requires careful risk management. We advise followers to begin with small absolute positions (relative to their accounts) and grow the trading size as confidence settles in.
FIVE OPEN POSITIONS MAXIMUM FOR ME. My stop loss near to 1% from entry price. Even if i am a technical or fundamental wizard, still need to be able to: 1) Pull the trigger 2) Pull the plug if the trade isn't working 3) Pull myself away from the markets when nothing worthwhile is happening. 4) Look for the outcomes My way of thinking is at least as important as the charts, if not more so. Money management and stop loss most important to make profits in a long term.

Again an intervention of the SNB, but like with all other interventions of the SNB, the price will retrace again soon.

Уважаемые последователи! Я работаю объёмом. Кто-то делает одну сделку с объёмом один лот и ждет результат. Я же, такой объём (один лот) делю на сто сделок. И ввожу эти сделки в работу по разному… То есть, в работе может находится максимум сто сделок с объёмом 0,01 лота, что в сумме составит один лот. Второе, я исключаю маленький размер SL – это убивает депозит!!! При нормальной работе SL рассчитывается по дневным свечам, а это более 250 Pips. Вы должны правильно рассчитывать соотношение своего депозита к рабочему объёму суммы сделок и их общей максимальной просадки. Удачи в торговле!

Таймфрейм - M1. При помощи индикатора MACD определяю волну, при помощи индикатора AO определяю место нахождения в этой волне (волну в волне). При помощи индикаторов RSI и Stochastik нахожу вершину и делаю вход в рынок. Если первый вход был не удачным, то произвожу второй вход, а после третий и так далее. Рекомендуемые настройки счета: депозит – 100$; плечо – 1/100; сделка – три ; объем лота – 0.01. После того, как открыта позиция, брокер забирает свою маржу. Она составит 10$. Прохождение ценой расстояние 10 Pips составит 1$. Маленький SL быстро убьет депозит, поэтому я рассчитываю его как 1/10 часть депозита без маржи. То есть, депозит без маржи составит 70$. Значит, 1/10 часть составит, приближенно, 7$. Если перевести это в Pips получаем размер SL, равный 70 Pips (это оптимальный вариант для последователя, у меня могут быть другие варианты). Размер прибыли может быть различным. Все усредненные результаты отражены в статистике счета. Удачи в торговле!

The time is now to get on board with the best trader on Zulu.Money management is the key to control the size of trading lots. Always use sound money management.Fibonacci is applied in my system model. We always look for breakout and retracement. We also use Stochastic,RSI,MACD, Moving averages, Bo-linger bands, candle formations to constantly produce profit. Trend line also give us good reason to enter the support and resistance levels.We keep our losses to a minimum and make every effort to ride out our Winners. 0 to 2 max trades in a row will be open in a day. Reduce the risk control in the first place as far as possible to stop loss at 70-100 pips. I will stick to my strategy and discipline.

La strategia prevede un massimo di entrate in media e uno stop loss. I parametri sono: conto 1.000 eur utilizzo di max 0.02 lot (meglio 0.01). Verranno effettuate più entrate e un cross per volta. Trading profittevole nel lungo periodo. il drawdown può arrivare anche a 1000 pip. Le entrate verranno comunque fatte seguendo indicatori personalizzati e trend follower su timeframe giornaliero e settimanale.
To be successful with my signals you need to allow at least four of my trades simultaneously (eight is even better). If you follow only one of my trades you may end up losing while I'm winning, because sometimes my system manages a group of trades as a basket that are closed at the same time. This system has been backtested for more than five years with excellent results. The stop loss and take profit are calculated dynamically, based on volatility. I recommend a capital allocation for each order of 0.03 lots (3 microlots) for every 1000 USD of equity. You can increase this amount up to 5 microlots per 1000 USD if you have a higher risk appetite. I don't recommend anything above these levels. You should use even lower levels if you are following other signal providers, depending on the strategy followed by each one, as the total risk can be compounded in those circumstances.

FINAL forex system a very advanced system that built mainly for the forex market with a lot of fanction we will try it for a limit time unless we will get a good feedback from the traders that will interest that we will continue to work with this system This systems cost a lot to go a live we will interesting to got a lot of feedback in order to know what you think a bout that system

My strategy is based on technical analysis, based on statistics. I am using bollinger band and simple moving average plus custom MACD indicator. I will try to use fixed 50pip SL, but flexible TP point. But once I am green 20pips, I will move my SL to breakeven. I don't really look in to fundamental analysis, but will care about the news timing.
I have been trading forex for more than 6 years with more focus on the technical side rather than fundamentals. I will be using a combination of three leading indicators for signals (both entry and exit ) and my trading hours will only be within london and new york sessions as this strategy is greatly dependent on momentum

Настраивайте копирование так, как я рекомендую и вы всегда будете получать только прибыль!
Set loss pips less than 50 pips then get about 20-100 pips every trade.Trade are focus on most currenices pairs only.he profit target is have 50 pips per week and have around 200-300 pips monthly.This singal will trade safety and can get some profits every month.You can use a demo account follow it,if you believe this singal can help you get profits then you can use your live account follow.Thank you!
My strategy depends on using technical analysis with the pairs gbp usd , usd jpy , eur usd and usd chf my target is not less than 120 pips and the stop loss is not more than 150 pips for each pair . discipline is the key for success . I wish you millions.
We will wait things going to smooth.
Name comes from riding direction and volume of the big banks. Naked trading using support and resistance zones, along with the bounding prices of the Asian session. Max open 2 trades, and DD/SL no greater than 80 pips. Hard TP at 120 pips, but for the most part will be closing before the next Asian session at visual support and resistance levels. Please use proper money management. Good luck!
I have a simple trading checklist and i use it religiously. It’s not just about finding a trade and placing it, it’s about actually finding the right trades and then having confidence to pull the trigger. My simple checklist / plan will assist me in filtering good signals from bad signals, and will also hold me accountable. Correct money management parameters can be applied to my checklist. Focus on EUR.USD pair.
Рынком форекс занимаюсь около восьми лет. Предлагаю вашему вниманию эту стратегию. Я постарался сделать так, чтобы DD был самый минимальный. Торговля ведется автоматически. Открываю всего одну позицию в день, SL по ней ставлю всегда. Перенос позиции на следующий день не предусмотрен, так что есть еще одно преимущество- отсутствует Swap. Удачи.
open position in strong price depending on Technical Analysis and some indicators, when market move against me i open another position every 40 pips or more, close each position in 40 pips gain, i move the take profit for all positions to new price depending on news and old Resistance & support.
I am trading very simple strategy. I am opening trades based on the daily chart. I am trading all currency pairs. I am searching the best opportunity to entry to position. I am using stop loss and take profit for each trade. I am opening only one trade per each currency pair. Maximum SL. is 100 pips.
The system looks to provide entries yielding excellent opportunities for good monthly profit. All currencies will be traded depending on the pair with the highest probability of win, please ensure you follow all signals. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk. Variables such as the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses as well as maintaining adequate liquidity are material points which can adversely affect actual real trading results.

Робот основан на фундаментальном анализе рынка, технический анализ используется только для более точного входа в рынок. Задействованы все основные коррелированные пары для торговли. Открывается не более двух сделок на каждом из шести инструментов. Таким образом, максимум одновременно открытых сделок составляет 12. Отсюда следует, что при 0.01 стандартного лота потребуется, с учетом возможной просадки, не менее 480$ для уверенного открытия сделок с плечом 1:100.

I use short term trading strategies for maximum profit. All always use stop loss and a rigid money management. I'm here for the long term, to have success in trading you have to pick a good strategy and stay with it. I'm here to give you this strategy for your success in trading!
My strategy is an short-term strategy which uses trades on some of the major currency pairs. I always keep the fundamentals in mind when trading but seek the trading opportunity out of technical analysis. My trading strategy is trend following but the position size and risk management with variation of the volatility of the market is the key to protect my account. I trading this way...analysis...plan...execute.
In this trading system, the trades are executed in both range bound and wide range markets. The channeling market also offers low risk, high reward trading opportunities. Besides, it is not only about getting in/out of a trade, but also about reviewing previous trends and positioning the trades in the direction of the most likely breakout, and in this way seeking additional profits. Various indicators like Stochastic and Bands are used for entry and exit including market facilitation index. The investors are advised not to exceed more than the signal provider's trading volume. Regards

My new investment strategy; Under fundamental analysis, judgment-based,reference technical indicators to operate. Each time positions 1-6,stop loss and win will make decisions based on the actual market situation. I will pay particular attention to risk control. Also, under uncertain circumstances i will reduce operations, or even stop the operation. When the situation is more clear, I will be relatively more radical. I hope that through our joint efforts to achieve a win-win.

Short term operation.The quiet market opportunity.Don't go along with the crowd.In a variety of monetary perplexing finding favorable opportunity, and then do a single.At the same time maximum of 3 list.Combined with the analytical skills, business knowledge and understanding of information, program design and management to control risk.That will bring you profit.
Latest update: Still SL/TP levels have been maintained. The system still working fine as the maximum simultaneous trades could go up to 8 so please change your setting so that all trades will be allowed to execute on your side otherwise you can't recover losses from previous ones. Thank for your understanding and happy pippy :)

My strategy is based on the daily candles . My trades can last from several hours to a few days , but they earns a lot of pips. I work always in favor of trend and i open a trade only when there is an input signal. Pin bars bearish or bullish , inside pin and binary pin are just a few example of input signals. And remember , the strategy based on the daily candles are the safest statistically la mia strategia si basa sulle candele da 4-8 ore o quelle giornaliere o meglio conosciute come pin bar. Aspetto un segnale di entrata che può essere una pin inside o una pin rialzista o ribassista. I miei trade si basano su pochi trade in modo da essere veloci per non rimanere troppo sul mercato.

In this trading system, the trades are executed in both range bound and wide range markets. The channeling market also offers low risk, high reward trading opportunities. Besides, it is not only about getting in/out of a trade, but also about reviewing previous trends and positioning the trades in the direction of the most likely breakout, and in this way seeking additional profits. Various indicators like Stochastic and Bands are used for entry and exit including market facilitation index. The investors are advised not to exceed more than the signal provider's trading volume.

This trader does not have an approved description yet.

This strategy is based on pivot points and ADX. It's symple but effective. Only ONE trade at same time. There is going to be take profit and stop loss, ALWAYS. Both are configured in 20-60 pips. As you can see this is not a trade and pray game. Good trades.

The main ingredient of a successful trading strategy is consistency. I have traded for more than 12 years and I have learned that consistency is the most important aspect of trading. That is why my main goal is to show consistency and have a low drawdown. I feel that if I am able to be consistent each and every trade reguardless if I lose in a particular trade, then I will be able to have many profitable months. I will trade the same way each trade and you will see that I am the best trader alive. I will trade only one system so that I can give this strategy my full attention. Sleep well knowing that I am the best trader alive.

HI FXCC1248750F thanks for a massage, I knew that zulu has some extra spread on followers so that why I had +1 trades (these trades are BE for me) but it looks like that doesn’t cover it. So, we have to find some compromise which doesn’t affect system and will help you cover extra spread so, from now on every time I want to move SL to BE (+1) and trade is + 20 or more I will move SL to +5 pips anything below 20 pips, and if I want to move SL to BE I will move to +2 I hope that this will help thanks

Hello, dear investors. I successfully trade on Forex about 4 years. My strategy depend on different combination of indicators.

I am CFTe & ACI Dealing Certificate Holder. Accordingly, I am specialized in trading strategies that operate mainly in trend phase. Experience shows that trading in trend phases reflect the best rate of return. In sideways phase, trades are opened restricted, according to the statistical method Value@Risk. I optimize the strategies on the premise of steady good return at low rate risk. My trading strategies are for mid-term investors (6 months +) interesting, that means: - A Max DD of not more than 15% - A target ROI per annum about 50+%, Over Performance possible - Each position has a SL / TP, the market has unpredictable moments - The trading strategies are based on the risk diversification (ie. model of Markowitz), compiled as a portfolio - I invest myself which means: we make profits and losses together and of course the target is a Top ROI As you can see, I am a technical trader with a neural touch, 4/5 of the trades are of a technical nature (both MM and SL / TP are technically defined) The neural touch means the personal experience. Based on my education & intensive study of the money market, I sometimes have a different picture of the market situation, therefore I take care of a few things, including ie. moving SL/TP to an important resistance line or the early closure of position when FED / ECB decision are imminent etc. I am very open & pls talk to me about anything. PS: Advice for Lot Size > prefer fix ratio money management which means: lot size = balance + ( delta*0,1 ), Delta means pips you prefer moving to the next lot size level. Higher Delta ( 300 - 500 ) means conservative, lower Delta means ( < 150 ) means progressive. I suggest 250 - 350.

Maximum risk is never exceeded 1...4% of account volume. Open positions are kept from several hours up to few days. A volatile level is taken into account for the trading systems.

This is a LOW RISK account . The target is win 50 pips by week . Mainly I use pivot points and trend lines . The maximum loose in a trade is 200 pips , in order to avoid the risk of great drawdown . It is possible some days I am out , that´s depend what about the economic calendar . The maximum drawdown also will never exceed 650 pips , so it is my strategy to close the trade and re open it , if I see that the risk to exceed the drawdown of 650 pips is high

This is a new system, which was tested for 1 year, and the results are excellent.This is save system. Traded only one currency pair EUR / USD. The actual operation of the system is done by an expert advisor and produces a signal every 30 minutes.Stop Loss will be manually triggered by myself or automatically by the EA depending on conditions. Patience and good luck to all followers.
capital protection is applied to my strategy by an algorithm that closes the trades without disclosing the stop loss. And that is for a simple reason, If the stop losses are disclosed then it creates market demand at those price levels. which is what I want to prevent from happening. In addition the orders are so small that even when it goes against us, the loss should not be so great.

The main trade strategy and the eur/usd,gbp/usd give priority to, the biggest stop 100 points, while the open 1 largest single, is expected to more than 100 a month can be stable profits, please put money control in $2000 follow 0.1 , we are in pursuit of long-term stable earnings, and strictly control risk, I wish you all good luck.
Mine is simple method based on the selected MT4 Custom Indicators which can be found across the web. I will be trading across any of the currencies from the list of EURUSD,AUDUSD,GBPUSD,USDJPY,NZDUSD,EURJPY,USDCAD,GBPJPY,NZDJPY,AUDJPY,GBPAUD,USDCHF. The pair selection might change and new pairs will be added in the portfolio, depends on spread and volatile nature. The target return is 25%-50% in any given month; the signals given here have the POTENTIAL to generate that with a MODERATE RISK, when ALL the MAIN trade signals and ADD-ON trade signals are taken. Max Trades is 10 to diversify the Risk. It could be 10 different pairs; Or 5 pairs with one main and one add-on; Or any combination; but each pair is limited to 2 trades. Instead of taking 1 lot in one single trade, split that into 0.10 lot across all 10 trades. I use max of 10 trades for a reason. The plan is, when I have 100 dollars to Risk, instead of Risking all in one trade, I am putting that money in 10 trades based on my signals to ease the Risk. It is still a Risk, a diversified Risk. The benefits of using 10 trades, are the Risk and Reward will be diversified across 10 Trades (though technically it is 656 pips DD it is actually a 65.6 pips DD when you follow this approach), allows us to take partial TP by closing any of the open position, allows us to spread out the position size in various time as it fits, we don't have to enter all the trades at the same time. As a signal provider I will do my best to give out the best possible signal which will likely to put money in your accounts with minimal drawdown. I don't want any of the signal subscribers to lose money; to avoid any unpredictable disaster, please Manage the Risk and use proper Margin in trading. In the end, all it matters is, Is there a PROFIT to show when month ends!!! Good Luck in Trading and Many Thanks for following my trade signals.

I request all my Followers to respect each and every Signal of my stratergy. Here is why I am suggesting you all .Thanks a lot for Following me.I work hard for our success----- -- Bettors and traders frequently consider or employ many of the same strategies. That is certainly true of adding to a position - whether building a trade that moves against you or one that is progressing in your favor. Both strategies draw frequent support and criticism. Adding to a position that moves against you can lower (raise if short) the breakeven point and thereby the level at which a trade turns profitable. That said, it also adds greater risk to a presently under-performing position. Increasing size into a trade that is making progress seems intuitively logical as the probabilities rise, but it also raising leverage. The pitfalls from either strategy can quickly take over as emotions swing from fear to greed. The solution is to make it a habitual element to a comprehensive strategy.

In today’s forex world specialising in one currency pair just isn't enough to stay ahead of the crowd. And that the key to managing a truly successful Long/Short portfolio is adequate exposure to several diverse pairs. Technical and fundamental trader because using chart confluence helps boost my performance in Forex. I use some volatility based indicators with MA.
• Bull Normal• Bull Volatile• Bear Normal• Bear Volatile• Sideways Quiet• Sideways Volatile , different market types. So must to identify market types and then applying a system to that market type, and my Forex trading becomes more fruitful. When they contract it is a sign the market type is normal or quiet, and when they expand that is a sign that the market type is more volatile.
It's unbelievable that making money in forex can be that simple though not easy to maintain the discipline to execute the plan or system.. I am a fundamental trader with a look to my own techs indicators. Incorporating the two together i think it makes me a truly powerful trader. The extreme volatility is arguably of greatest concern to those leveraged to the global carry trade. Two to four trades maximum.

HELLO ! This account makes only TREND FOLLOWING trades, only on the EUR/GBP pair. This because for me EUR/GBP is the most predictable and orderly pair in the market. Its ranges are usually small, it is not volatile at all and the price of a pip of the pair is the biggest of all currency pairs. As it does not form large ranges one does not need to place big stop. Hence, the algorithm superposes 3 strategies each with a specific timing and a specific target. ONLY 3 SIMULTANEOUS TRADES max. STOP LOSS are monitored to have an INSTANTANEOUS DRAWDOWN OF ~300 pips MAXI. NO fear to take our losses when needed and to let the profit grows. NO HEDGING at all, NO MARTINGALE, NO MODIFICATION of the strategy. Only Serenity, Patience and Strict application of the trading rules. ENJOY

ready for trade ?:) follow me :)

My strategy is using statistics and probability theory for trading and purely mechanical. This algorithm is working almost on all of main pairs and their crosses but I've chosen only 8 from there. This is a multiple-pairs trading system that can open up to 3 pairs at the same time but I'll never risk more than one percent per pair.
hello followers i thank you for trusting me and i hope good luck for you all.
Gbp / aud will go down, unless there are extraordinary intervention.
Hello guys. As you might have noticed; almost every stable trader has been struggeling the past month. If you have been with, adjusting the risk 1:1 as I always have been asking you for; you are almost even now after a stellar start. I have to pull the plug for now. That means; please disconnect your account now if you haven´t done so yet. I will take this hard time to learn my lesson for now. I´m already working on a new system, that has a fix SL of 100pips and much less open trades at the same time! If I feel compfortable enough in a few month I will start over again. Thank all those of you who have followed me through this time!

Let's hope this is just a pull-back in the down-trend. Either way please don't lecture us as that's not what you are paid for. The only thing that matter is making money, not being right. You can only make money if you manage and minimize draw-down, which right now you are not doing!

Adjustable MA 3G strategy, based on the custom 3rd Generation Moving Average indicator and the classic cross-of-two-MAs strategy. Using a 5-minute EUR/USD chart I will trade once every two days on average. I will be using fixed stop-loss at 100 pips and a take-profit at 70 pips. My experience has shown that this strategy can lead to ~416% profit with ~10.5% maximum draw-down in a long term time frame.

I have seen consistency by using technical patterns with match with my personality and goals. My strategy is focused on short term trades i will try to act like a Cheetah get the pips when i see opportunity and get out with 20-40 pips that will increase your's account I trade on the major pairs and I mainly monitor break of support and resistance. Parameter advise: 1-3 positions with a stop loss between 50 .thankyou.
I use a very simple strategy, based on software I wrote myself from scratch. My system usually opens between 1 and 12 positions. I set stop losses of 60 pips to 100 pips and always honor them. Average position trade time is 24 hours. I operate with a broad range of instruments and always try to minimize risk by spreading it among different instruments. Just look at my performance numbers. The numbers speak for themselves.

that tries to simulate brain activity, by using classic conditioning, retraining itself when it doesn't get the expected result (lots of pips), and remembering what it did well the last time it got a lot of pips! Our system is always learning, and our predictions can only get better with time. We have implemented a trailing stop that moves the stop to breakeven when the trades has a profit of 80 pips or more, this however is not updated in metatrader but instead our system takes care of closing the trade when the stop is triggered. So it is not visible in zulutrade but still it is on place. Also, the stop for every trade is now 75 pips, it wont be changed once the trade is open.

the information that Daily FX provides us free to “train” our neurons. The recommendations will be like this: for each recommendation and currency pair our system opens a single lot. The maximum stop loss for every trade is 200 pips (depending on market conditions) and it is never modified after the trade is open. Please NEVER leverage more than 1:1 (i.e. 1 micro lot for every $1000 in your account) for any single trade. *neuronal network: is a computer algorithm that tries to simulate brain activity, by using classic conditioning, retraining itself when it doesn't get the expected result (lots of pips), and remembering what it did well the last time it got a lot of pips!

So it is not visible in zulutrade but still it is on place. Also, the stop for every trade is now 75 pips, it wont be changed once the trade is open.

Sono ormai 12 anni che mi occupo di Forex, il mio lavoro, la mia passione la mia ossessione. Operare con il forex in manuale come faccio io vuol dire studiare grafici 7 giorni su sette a qualsiasi orario. Ci sono molte tecniche valide per guadagnare con il forex ma tutte ovviamente non possono vincere in qualsiasi condizione è quindi bisogna cercare di capire quale tecnica adattare in un dato momento. Questo è ciò che faccio, cerco di profittare di una tecnica in un dato momento. La mia cronlogia dice che in passato ci sono stati eccessivi rischi ma più che altro dovuti a cercare di incremmentare la posizione in classifica Zulutrade, oggi questo non accade più, le mie posizioni hanno sempre uno SL inoltre sono costantemente monitorate e lo potete verificare nel DD degli ultimi mesi. Questo non vuol dire che non ci saranno perdite perchè non sono infallibile e soprattutto perchè chi conosce il Forex sa che non ci sono regole fisse e questo rende tutto più complicato. Vi posso solo garantire la serietà di non giocare con i vostri ed i miei soldi. Grazie se deciderete di seguirmi!!!

My system based on 5 EA, each EA was tested in 12 years history, working together on EURUSD pair only but on different time frames and different strategy's. Max around 5 trades in the same time, some times positions will be opening for more than one day. The strategy works with relatively medium leverage and medium risk. I trade with long profits (80-240 pips).
Tttiger A short term multi-moving average cross-over system that's 100% mechanical. We will trade a very short time mainly EURO/USA GBP/USD but if we find other good trade we will trade also with other pairs. Please note that it is very short time and will be positive and nagative traders but you have to check the long time that will have to be positive and also time of every trade will be very very short time DD will be 100pips MAX FROM NOW if we will have more will be out it will be a new system not like the other hope you will like this and find it good for you.

We are working on less aggressive version of ForexAnomaly, i.e. no more 10 orders opened at once and no more 200 pips DD.

FOREXZONE [EURAUD] is a Breakout trading system. - The style trading is SHORT-TERM. - We open five trades at the same time for the EURAUD pair with diferents targets for each one, using BREAK EVENS, STOPLOSS, and TRAILING STOPS. - The BreakEven is set on 50 Pips. - Min open trades at same time are (5). - Max open trades at same tine are (30). - Our trading concept is, cut the LOSSES, and let the PROFITS RUN!!.

How do you do. I am kamekame.It attacks on a point with the high certainty of profits.The loss is cut certainly. In order to carry out a high strikerate, a position takes time. Short-term possession.Please give me investment after often checking.He does his best so that profits may be gained.
The method of trading is not something new or extra what other traders do, main goal of success is stability, lower risk (2%, or less per trade), regular basis profit, and of course human factors play biggest role in my system: trading with less emotions, not trade if I feel tired, stressed, excitement, too happy and more of the similar feelings, which effects on the trading. check and rate this system
we start to accumulate buy eur / chf in how much under 1.20 cannot go given the floor of the SNB.
stop loss you see I wrote Positions 4-8 up, but only if positive trade
Bad start of the year. Its happened due to market conditions were not suitable for my strategy. Mainly due to the low volatility.
